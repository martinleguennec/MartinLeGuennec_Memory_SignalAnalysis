  abstract = {The process of learning a novel body movement exposes a student to multiple difficulties. Understanding the range of motion is fundamental for learning to control the involved body parts. Theory and instructions need to be mapped to body movements: a student not only needs to mimic or copy the range of motion of individual body parts, but he also needs to trigger the motion fragments in the correct order. Not only correct order is important, but also precise timing. If the movements in questions are intensified by additional load, optimality of the motion patterns becomes crucial. Sub-optimal execution of an exercise reduces the performance or can even induce failure of completion. Correct execution is a subtle interplay between the correct forces at the right times. In this paper, we present a sensor system that is able to categorize movements into multiple quality classes and athletes into two experience classes. For this work we conducted a study involving 16 athletes performing squat-presses, a simple yet non-trivial exercise requiring barbells. We calculated various features out of raw accelerometer data acquired by two inertial measurement units attached to the athletes' bodies. We evaluated exercise performances of the participants ranging from beginners to experts. We introduce the biomechanical properties of the movement and show that our system can differentiate between four quality classes (poor, fair, good, perfect) with an accuracy above 93\% and discriminate between a beginner athlete and an advanced athlete with an accuracy of more than 94\%.},

  abstract = {The motor cortex and spinal cord possess the remarkable ability to alter structure and function in response to differential motor training. Here we review the evidence that the corticospinal system is not only plastic but that the nature and locus of this plasticity is dictated by the specifics of the motor experience. Skill training induces synaptogenesis, synaptic potentiation, and reorganization of movement representations within motor cortex. Endurance training induces angiogenesis in motor cortex, but it does not alter motor map organization or synapse number. Strength training alters spinal motoneuron excitability and induces synaptogenesis within spinal cord, but it does not alter motor map organization. All three training experiences induce changes in spinal reflexes that are dependent on the specific behavioral demands of the task. These results demonstrate that the acquisition of skilled movement induces a reorganization of neural circuitry within motor cortex that supports the production and refinement of skilled movement sequences. We present data that suggest increases in strength may be mediated by an increased capacity for activation and/or recruitment of spinal motoneurons while the increased metabolic demands associated with endurance training induce cortical angiogenesis. Together these results show the robust pattern of anatomic and physiological plasticity that occurs within the corticospinal system in response to differential motor experience. The consequences of such distributed, experience-specific plasticity for the encoding of motor experience by the motor system are discussed.},

  abstract = {The ergogenic effect of caffeine is well-established, but the extent of its consumption in sport is unknown at the present. The use of caffeine was considered ``prohibited'' until 2004, but this stimulant was moved from the List of Prohibited Substances to the Monitoring Program of the World Anti-Doping Agency to control its use by monitoring urinary caffeine concentration after competition. However, there is no updated information about the change in the use of caffeine as the result of its inclusion in the Monitoring Program. The aim of this study was to describe the changes in urine caffeine concentration from 2004 to 2015. A total of 7488 urine samples obtained in official competitions held in Spain and corresponding to athletes competing in Olympic sports (2788 in 2004, 2543 in 2008, and 2157 in 2015) were analyzed for urine caffeine concentration. The percentage of samples with detectable caffeine (i.e., {$>$}0.1 {$\mu$}g/mL) increased from \textasciitilde 70.1\%, in 2004\textendash 2008 to 75.7\% in 2015. The median urine caffeine concentration in 2015 (0.85 {$\mu$}g/mL) was higher when compared to the median value obtained in 2004 (0.70 {$\mu$}g/mL; p {$<$} 0.05) and in 2008 (0.70 {$\mu$}g/mL; p {$<$} 0.05). The urine caffeine concentration significantly increased from 2004 to 2015 in aquatics, athletics, boxing, judo, football, weightlifting, and rowing (p {$<$} 0.05). However, the sports with the highest urine caffeine concentration in 2015 were cycling, athletics, and rowing. In summary, the concentration of caffeine in the urine samples obtained after competition in Olympic sports in Spain increased from 2004 to 2015, particularly in some disciplines. These data indicate that the use of caffeine has slightly increased since its removal from the list of banned substances, but urine caffeine concentrations suggest that the use of caffeine is moderate in most sport specialties. Athletes of individual sports or athletes of sports with an aerobic-like nature are more prone to using caffeine in competition.},

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a wearable surface electromyogram device that can be used to measure and to monitor muscle activity during aerobic exercise. A 10-bit analog to digital converter (ADC) micro-controller board is selected to obtain and process the data sensed by Ag/AgCl wet electrodes. The obtained data is transmitted to the computer via Bluetooth's wireless technology using HC-05 master-slave module. In prior, the wearable is attached to the palmaris longus muscle in two different activities known as isometric and isotonic contractions. The fourth-order Butterworth filter is applied to eliminate the noise and filtering the raw signal in order to produce a clean EMG signal. Then, the device is compared with the commercial EMG to validate the signal obtained and to ensure the result is reliable. The results reveal that the high consistency of the voltage amplitude is successfully achieved in the high reliability of exercise voluntary contractions especially for isotonic and isometric. These types of contraction are distinguished able from the pattern of signal. The error of signal analysis is {$<$} 5\% in validity test verified the accuracy of this device compared with the other device available in the market. This device is potentially can be used for upper extremity of aerobic exercise in measuring the muscle contraction, and it is beneficial for the biomedical and sports application environment.},

J Strength Cond Res 23(4): 1129-1134, 2009-Acute neuromuscular responses to maximum versus forced repetition (FR) knee extension resistance exercises (4 sets of 12 repetitions [reps] with a 2-minute recovery between the sets) were examined in 4 male strength athletes (SAs) and 4 nonathletes. Maximum repetition (MR) sets were performed to voluntary exhaustion (12 repetition maximum [RM]), whereas in the FR sets, the load was greater (8RM) and the set was continued after voluntary fatigue with 4 additional assisted reps. Maximal isometric force and electromyogram (EMG) activity of the knee extensors were measured before and after the exercise, as well as 2 recovery days after the exercise. Electromyogram activity was also measured during the actual concentric phases of the knee extensions. Both loading protocols in both groups led to decreases in isometric force, but no significant changes were observed in EMG activity during isometric actions at any time points. However, the difference between the 2 loading protocols and experimental groups was observed in muscle activity during the concentric phases of the knee extensions. As expected, EMG activity increased in both groups throughout the MR sets when compared with the first repetitions of the sets. Only in SAs, EMG activity decreased significantly at the end of the FR sets. The results suggest that experienced SAs were capable to activate their muscles to a greater extent than their non-strength-trained counterparts indicated by neural fatigue during the FR exercise. Greater motor unit activation in SAs than in nonathletes may be due to training-induced neural adaptation, which manifested during fatiguing exercise. The present study suggests that FRs are an efficient training protocol to overload the neuromuscular system especially in SAs.},

Whether an intensity-dependent threshold occurs following acute strength training of the knee extensors (KE) remains unclear. We assessed the corticospinal responses following high-intensity (85\% of maximal strength) or low-intensity (30\% of maximal strength) KE strength-training with measures taken during an isometric KE task at baseline, post-5, 30 and 60-min. Twenty-eight volunteers (23~{$\pm~$}3~years) were randomized to high-intensity (n =~11), low-intensity (n~=~10) or to a control group (n =~7). Corticospinal responses were evoked with transcranial magnetic stimulation at intracortical and corticospinal levels. High- or low-intensity KE strength-training had no effect on maximum voluntary contraction force post-exercise (P {$>~$}0.05). High-intensity training increased corticospinal excitability (range 130-180\%) from 5 to 60~min post-exercise compared to low-intensity training (17-30\% increase). Large effect sizes (ES) showed that short-interval cortical inhibition (SICI) was reduced only for the high-intensity training group from 5-60~min post-exercise (24-44\% decrease) compared to low-intensity (ES ranges 1-1.3). These findings show a training-intensity threshold is required to adjust CSE and SICI following strength training in the lower limb.},

We describe competing types of illumination (transillumination, reflectance, and differential reflectance) and data collection methods (continuous wave, time domain, and frequency domain). Basic components (light sources, detection, and recording components) of fNIRS systems are presented. Advantages and limitations of fNIRS techniques are offered, followed by a list of very practical recommendations for its use. A variety of experimental and clinical studies with fNIRS are sampled, shedding light on many brain-related ailments. Finally, we describe and discuss a number of freely available analysis and presentation packages suited for data analysis. In conclusion, we recommend fNIRS due to its ever-growing body of clinical applications, state-of-the-art neuroimaging technique, and manageable hardware requirements. It can be safely concluded that fNIRS adds a new arrow to the quiver of neuro-medical examinations due to both its great versatility and limited costs.},

We examined the effects of C on exercise performance and its interaction with peripheral quadriceps fatigue. Eight trained males performed four 5 km cycling time trials (power output voluntarily adjustable) at four levels of C (17.6\textendash 24.4 ml O2 dl-1), induced by variations in inspired O2 fraction (0.15\textendash 1.0). Peripheral quadriceps fatigue was assessed via changes in force output pre- versus post-exercise in response to supra-maximal magnetic femoral nerve stimulation ({$\Delta$}Qtw; 1\textendash 100 Hz). Central neural drive during the time trials was estimated via quadriceps electromyogram. Increased C from hypoxia to hyperoxia resulted in parallel increases in central neural output (43\%) and power output (30\%) during cycling and improved time trial performance (12\%); however, the magnitude of {$\Delta$}Qtw (-33 to -35\%) induced by the exercise was not different among the four time trials (P {$>$} 0.2). These effects of C on time trial performance and {$\Delta$}Qtw were reproducible (coefficient of variation = 1\textendash 6\%) over repeated trials at each F on separate days. In the same subjects, changing C also affected performance time to exhaustion at a fixed work rate, but similarly there was no effect of {$\Delta$}C on peripheral fatigue. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the effect of C on locomotor muscle power output and exercise performance time is determined to a significant extent by the regulation of central motor output to the working muscle in order that peripheral muscle fatigue does not exceed a critical threshold.},

  abstract = {The capacity of motor cortical systems to drive voluntary motoneuronal output changes during fatiguing exercise and thus influences the development of central fatigue and performance. It is too simplistic to conclude that decreases in motor cortical or motoneuronal excitability may contribute to central fatigue and impaired performance as some studies show increased corticomotoneuronal excitability in some exercise modalities. Endogenous forms of neuromodulation, such as serotonin released from neurones, can alter central fatigue and motoneuronal output. Exogenous forms of neuromodulation, such as non-invasive brain stimulation, may also do this, but current evidence is not convincing. Further well-controlled studies and replications are needed to expose the cause-and-effect relationship between brain responsiveness and exercise performance Neural drive originating in higher brain areas reaches exercising limb muscles through the corticospinal-motoneuronal pathway which links the motor cortex and spinal motoneurones. The properties of this pathway have frequently been observed to change during fatiguing exercise in ways that could influence the development of central fatigue, i.e. the progressive reduction in voluntary muscle activation. However, based on differences in motor cortical and motoneuronal excitability between exercise modalities (e.g. single-joint vs locomotor exercise), there is no characteristic response that allows for a categorical conclusion about the effect of these changes on functional impairments and performance limitations. Despite the lack of uniformity in findings during fatigue, there is strong evidence for marked `inhibition' of motoneurones as a direct result of voluntary drive. Endogenous forms of neuromodulation, such as via serotonin released from neurones, can directly affect motoneuronal output and central fatigue. Exogenous forms of neuromodulation, such as brain stimulation, may achieve a similar effect, but the evidence is weak. Non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation can cause transient or long-lasting changes in cortical excitability, however, variable results across studies cast doubt on its claimed capacity to enhance performance. Furthermore, with these studies it is difficult to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between brain responsiveness and exercise performance. This review briefly summarises changes in the corticomotoneuronal pathway during various types of exercise, considers the relevance of these changes for the development of central fatigue, and the potential of non-invasive brain stimulation to enhance motor cortical excitability, motoneuronal output, and, ultimately, exercise performance.

  abstract = {We asked whether the central effects of fatiguing locomotor muscle fatigue exert an inhibitory influence on central motor drive to regulate the total degree of peripheral fatigue development. Eight cyclists performed constant-workload prefatigue trials (a) to exhaustion (83\% of peak power output (Wpeak), 10 {$\pm$} 1 min; PFT83\%), and (b) for an identical duration but at 67\%Wpeak (PFT67\%). Exercise-induced peripheral quadriceps fatigue was assessed via changes in potentiated quadriceps twitch force ({$\Delta$}Qtw,pot) from pre- to post-exercise in response to supra-maximal femoral nerve stimulation ({$\Delta$}Qtw,pot). On different days, each subject randomly performed three 5 km time trials (TTs). First, subjects repeated PFT83\% and the TT was started 4 min later with a known level of pre-existing locomotor muscle fatigue ({$\Delta$}Qtw,pot-36\%) (PFT83\%-TT). Second, subjects repeated PFT67\% and the TT was started 4 min later with a known level of pre-existing locomotor muscle fatigue ({$\Delta$}Qtw,pot-20\%) (PFT67\%-TT). Finally, a control TT was performed without any pre-existing level of fatigue. Central neural drive during the three TTs was estimated via quadriceps EMG. Increases in pre-existing locomotor muscle fatigue from control TT to PFT83\%-TT resulted in significant dose-dependent changes in central motor drive (-23\%), power output (-14\%), and performance time (+6\%) during the TTs. However, the magnitude of locomotor muscle fatigue following various TTs was not different ({$\Delta$}Qtw,pot of -35 to -37\%, P= 0.35). We suggest that feedback from fatiguing muscle plays an important role in the determination of central motor drive and force output, so that the development of peripheral muscle fatigue is confined to a certain level.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the application of the Hilbert spectrum (HS), which is a recent tool for the analysis of nonlinear and nonstationary time-series, to the study of electromyographic (EMG) signals. The HS allows for the visualization of the energy of signals through a joint time\textendash frequency representation. In this work we illustrate the use of the HS in two distinct applications. The first is for feature extraction from EMG signals. Our results showed that the instantaneous mean frequency (IMNF) estimated from the HS is a relevant feature to clinical practice. We found that the median of the IMNF reduces when the force level of the muscle contraction increases. In the second application we investigated the use of the HS for detection of motor unit action potentials (MUAPs). The detection of MUAPs is a basic step in EMG decomposition tools, which provide relevant information about the neuromuscular system through the morphology and firing time of MUAPs. We compared, visually, how MUAP activity is perceived on the HS with visualizations provided by some traditional (e.g. scalogram, spectrogram, Wigner\textendash Ville) time\textendash frequency distributions. Furthermore, an alternative visualization to the HS, for detection of MUAPs, is proposed and compared to a similar approach based on the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Our results showed that both the proposed technique and the CWT allowed for a clear visualization of MUAP activity on the time\textendash frequency distributions, whereas results obtained with the HS were the most difficult to interpret as they were extremely affected by spurious energy activity.},

  abstract = {New Findings What is the central question of the study? Are corticospinal responses to acute and short-term squat resistance training task-specific? What is the main finding and its importance? A single bout of resistance training increased spinal excitability, but no changes in corticospinal responses were noted following 4 weeks of squat training despite task-specific increases in strength. The present data suggest that processes along the corticospinal pathway of the knee extensors play a limited role in the task-specific increase in strength following resistance training. Abstract Neural adaptations subserving strength increases have been shown to be task-specific, but responses and adaptation to lower-limb compound exercises such as the squat are commonly assessed in a single-limb isometric task. This two-part study assessed neuromuscular responses to an acute bout (Study A) and 4 weeks (Study B) of squat resistance training at 80\% of one-repetition-maximum, with measures taken during a task-specific isometric squat (IS) and non-specific isometric knee extension (KE). Eighteen healthy volunteers (25 {$\pm$} 5 years) were randomised into either a training (n = 10) or a control (n = 8) group. Neural responses were evoked at the intracortical, corticospinal and spinal levels, and muscle thickness was assessed using ultrasound. The results of Study A showed that the acute bout of squat resistance training decreased maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) for up to 45 min post-exercise (-23\%, P {$<$} 0.001). From 15\textendash 45 min post-exercise, spinally evoked responses were increased in both tasks (P = 0.008); however, no other evoked responses were affected (P {$\geq$} 0.240). Study B demonstrated that following short-term resistance training, participants improved their one repetition maximum squat (+35\%, P {$<$} 0.001), which was reflected by a task-specific increase in IS MVC (+49\%, P = 0.001), but not KE (+1\%, P = 0.882). However, no training-induced changes were observed in muscle thickness (P = 0.468) or any evoked responses (P = 0.141). Adjustments in spinal motoneuronal excitability are evident after acute resistance training. After a period of short-term training, there were no changes in the responses to central nervous system stimulation, which suggests that alterations in corticospinal properties of the vastus lateralis might not contribute to increases in strength.},

Previous studies have revealed that motor execution (ME) and motor imagery (MI) share many common neural substrates; however, whether inhibitory neural activity occurs during MI remains unknown. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that a combined MI and action observation (MI\,+\,AO) produces strong neurophysiological changes compared with MI or AO alone. Therefore, we investigated inhibitory changes in cortical and spinal excitability of the antagonist muscle during MI\,+\,AO and ME. Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) experiments revealed that corticospinal excitability of the antagonist muscle was decreased during MI\,+\,AO. Conversely, F-wave experiments showed that F-wave persistence of the antagonist muscle increased. Paired-pulse TMS experiment also demonstrated that short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) did not contribute to this inhibition. Therefore, cortical mediated inhibition, except for SICI, may be related to this inhibition. Conversely, such clear inhibition of the antagonist muscle was not observed during ME, presumably owing to the effects of muscle contraction to decelerate the movements and/or sensory input accompanying the joint movements. These findings provide important insights into the neurophysiological differences between MI\,+\,AO and ME.},

A rather simplified version of this task is studied in the sensorimotor synchronization paradigm. Participants are instructed to synchronize their finger taps with an isochronous sequence of signals (e.g., clicks). Although this is an easy task, a systematic error is observed: Taps usually precede clicks by several tens of milliseconds. Different models have been proposed to account for this effect ("negative asynchrony" or "synchronization error"). One group of explanations is based on the idea that synchrony is established at the level of central representations (and not at the level of external events), and that the timing of an action is determined by the (anticipated) action effect. These assumptions are tested by manipulating the amount of sensory feedback available from the tap as well as its temporal characteristics. This article presents an overview of these representational models and the empirical evidence supporting them. It also discusses other accounts briefly in the light of further evidence.},

  abstract = {The coupling of movement behavior and environmental signals has been extensively studied within the domain of rhythmic coordination tasks. However, in contrast to most traditional coordination studies, here we drive the coupled sensorimotor system far beyond the frequency regime in which these signals may be synchronized. Our goal is to identify the properties of the coupling between the human subject and the environment. Earlier studies have shown that the environmental signal may be parametrically coupled to the effectors. A necessary feature of parametrically driven oscillators is the existence of stable 1:1 and 1:2 coordination modes. Here, we test this prediction experimentally using a coordination paradigm in which subjects were asked to coincide peak finger flexion with an auditory metronome beat. The rate of the metronome was increased in steps of 0.5 Hz from 2.5 Hz to 12 Hz. It was observed that the subjects shifted involuntarily from a 1:1 to a 1:2 coordination mode at high driving frequencies, as predicted. These results are examined in the context of an extended form of the Haken\textendash Kelso\textendash Bunz (Haken et al. 1985) model (HKB) for bimanual coordination, which includes a parametric driving term (Jirsa et al. 2000). Unimanual coordination is treated as a special case of this extended model. An important feature of the HKB model is bistability and the presence of a phase transition from an anti-phase mode to in-phase mode of coordination. Our description of unimanual coordination leads to a mechanism for phase transitions that is distinct from that seen in the HKB model. The transition is mediated by the dynamics of both the amplitude and the phase of the oscillator. More generally, we propose the existence of two types of transitions in our extended theory, that is, phase-mediated and amplitude-mediated transitions. Both have characteristic features; in particular, their transients are mutually orthogonal in the plane spanned by the amplitude and phase of the oscillator. The analytical and numerical results of our theoretical model are demonstrated to compare favorably with our experimental results.},

  abstract = {This review is concerned with understanding how vasodilation initiated from local sites in the tissue can spread to encompass multiple branches of the resistance vasculature. Within tissues, arteriolar networks control the distribution and magnitude of capillary perfusion. Vasodilation arising from the microcirculation can `ascend' into feed arteries that control blood flow into arteriolar networks. Thus distal segments of the resistance network signal proximal segments to dilate and thereby increase total oxygen supply to parenchymal cells. August Krogh proposed that innervation of capillaries provided the mechanism for a spreading vasodilatory response. With greater understanding of the ultrastructural organization of resistance networks, an alternative explanation has emerged: Electrical signalling from cell to cell along the vessel wall through gap junctions. Hyperpolarization originates from ion channel activation at the site of stimulation with the endothelium serving as the predominant cellular pathway for signal conduction along the vessel wall. As hyperpolarization travels, it is transmitted into surrounding smooth muscle cells through myoendothelial coupling to promote relaxation. Conducted vasodilation (CVD) encompasses greater distances than can be explained by passive decay and understanding such behaviour is the focus of current research efforts. In the context of athletic performance, the ability of vasodilation to ascend into feed arteries is essential to achieving peak levels of muscle blood flow. CVD is tempered by sympathetic neuroeffector signalling when governing muscle blood flow at rest and during exercise. Impairment of conduction during ageing and in diseased states can limit physical work capacity by restricting muscle blood flow.},

Key points \textbullet{} The explanation of macroscopic sport-related phenomena cannot be reduced to molecular levels. \textbullet{} Physiological states are products of nested dynamics of vertical (among levels) and horizontal (among components of the same level) nonlinear interactions. \textbullet{} Network Physiology of Exercise provides data analysis techniques to investigate how systems coordinate and synchronize in an integrative way.},

  abstract = {Assessing the neural correlates of motor and cognitive processes under naturalistic experimentation is challenging due to the movement constraints of traditional brain imaging technologies. The recent advent of portable technologies that are less sensitive to motion artifacts such as Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) have been made possible the study of brain function in freely-moving participants. In this paper, we describe a series of proof-of-concept experiments examining the potential of fNIRS in assessing the neural correlates of cognitive and motor processes in unconstrained environments. We show illustrative applications for practicing a sport (i.e., table tennis), playing a musical instrument (i.e., piano and violin) alone or in duo and performing daily activities for many hours (i.e., continuous monitoring). Our results expand upon previous research on the feasibility and robustness of fNIRS to monitor brain hemodynamic changes in different real life settings. We believe that these preliminary results showing the flexibility and robustness of fNIRS measurements may contribute by inspiring future work in the field of applied neuroscience.},

  abstract = {Quantitative measures of smoothness play an important role in the assessment of sensorimotor impairment and motor learning. Traditionally, movement smoothness has been computed mainly for discrete movements, in particular arm, reaching and circle drawing, using kinematic data. There are currently very few studies investigating smoothness of rhythmic movements, and there is no systematic way of analysing the smoothness of such movements. There is also very little work on the smoothness of other movement related variables such as force, impedance etc. In this context, this paper presents the first step towards a unified framework for the analysis of smoothness of arbitrary movements and using various data. It starts with a systematic definition of movement smoothness and the different factors that influence smoothness, followed by a review of existing methods for quantifying the smoothness of discrete movements. A method is then introduced to analyse the smoothness of rhythmic movements by generalising the techniques developed for discrete movements. We finally propose recommendations for analysing smoothness of any general sensorimotor behaviour.},

This paper posits that to date methodological approaches to normalization has been ineffective and has limited the application of electromyography. There is minimal investigation seeking alternative normalization methods, which must be corrected to improve EMG application in sports. It is recognised that differing normalization methods will prevent cross-study comparisons. Users of EMG should aim to identify normalization methods that provide good reliability and a representative measure of muscle activation. The shortcomings of current normalization methods in high velocity muscle actions assessment are evident. Advances in assessing alternate normalization methods have been done in cycling and sprinting. It is advised that when normalizing high intensity muscle actions, isometric methods are used with caution and a dynamic alternative, where the muscle action is similar to that of that task is preferred. It is recognised that optimal normalization methods may be muscle and task dependant.},

We found age and sex to be the most complex factors in predicting powerlifting results. For women, in general, the younger the woman is the more they can squat; the older the woman is the less they can squat. For men and women, with the 1 exception for women's squat, the peak age of lifting power is between the ages 24\textendash 49, at which point lifting power slowly declines. Women's peak performance declines faster than men's peak performance. Women seem to reach their peak sooner than men and decline sooner than men. We also analyzed match attendance. At matches with a large number of competitors, there is a 1:1.7 ratio of women to men, approximately a 2\textendash 3 ratio of women to men. Except for the lightest weight category of men, the ratio of weight to lift decreases the more they weigh. For example, a lighter person can generally lift a greater percentage of their weight than a heavier person. In addition, men in general can lift a heavier ratio of their weight when compared with women. The powerlifting stereotype of mostly heavy men lifting extremely large amounts of weights is simply wrong. There is a large amount of variation in age, weight, and sex.},

Fifty-seven healthy men (untrained [UNT] n = 29, short-term RT [12WK] n = 14, and long-term RT [4YR] n = 14) performed maximum and sub-maximum (20\%-80\% maximum voluntary torque [MVT]) unilateral isometric knee extension contractions with torque, agonist and antagonist surface EMG recorded. Agonist EMG, including at MVT, was corrected for the confounding effects of adiposity (ie, muscle-electrode distance; measured with ultrasonography). Quadriceps maximum anatomical cross-sectional area (QACSAMAX; via MRI) was also assessed. MVT was distinct for all three groups (4YR +60/+39\% vs UNT/12WK; 12WK +15\% vs UNT; 0.001 {$<$} P {$\leq$} 0.021), and QACSAMAX was greater for 4YR (+50/+42\% vs UNT/12WK; [both] P {$<$} 0.001). Agonist EMG at MVT was +44/+33\% greater for 4YR /12WK ([both] P {$<$} 0.001) vs. UNT, but did not differ between RT groups. The torque-agonist EMG relationship of 4YR displayed a right/down shift with lower agonist EMG at the highest common torque (196 Nm) compared to 12WK and UNT (0.005 {$\leq$} P {$\leq$} 0.013; Effect size [ES] 0.90 {$\leq$} ES {$\leq$} 1.28). The torque-antagonist EMG relationship displayed a lower slope with increasing RT duration (4YR {$<$} 12WK {$<$} UNT; 0.001 {$<$} P {$\leq$} 0.094; 0.56 {$\leq$} ES {$\leq$} 1.31), and antagonist EMG at the highest common torque was also lower for 4YR than UNT (-69\%; P {$<$} 0.001; ES = 1.18). In conclusion, 4YR and 12WK had similar agonist activation at MVT and this adaptation may be maximized during early months of RT. In contrast, inter-muscular coordination, specifically antagonist coactivation was progressively lower, and likely continues to adapt, with prolonged RT.},

Peak-normalized surface electromyography of the rectus femoris, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius medialis, and tibialis anterior during the knee flexion and extension phases of squat exercises was analyzed. There were significant differences among the conditions during the knee flexion phase for the rectus femoris (p = 0.001), biceps femoris (p = 0.038), and tibialis anterior (p = 0.001), with increasing activation from conditions I to III. For the gastrocnemius medialis, there were significant differences among the conditions during the knee extension phase (p = 0.023), with increased activity under condition I.

The tibialis anterior activity was higher during the flexion compared with the extension phase under all conditions, and the medial gastrocnemius activity was higher during the extension phase under condition I. Doing squats with abdominal drawing-in and Pilates breathing resulted in increased rectus, biceps femoris, and tibialis anterior activity during the flexion phase, increasing movement stability during squat exercises.},

By measuring the state of oxygenation of the primary heme compounds in skeletal muscle (hemoglobin and myoglobin), greater understanding of the underlying control mechanisms that couple perfusive and diffusive oxygen delivery to oxidative metabolism can be gained from the laboratory to the athletic field to the intensive care unit or emergency room. However, the field of NIRS has been complicated by the diversity of instrumentation, the inherent limitations of some of these technologies, the associated diversity of terminology, and a general lack of standardization of protocols. This Cores of Reproducibility in Physiology (CORP) will describe in basic but important detail the most common methodologies of NIRS, their strengths and limitations, and discuss some of the potential confounding factors that can affect the quality and reproducibility of NIRS data. Recommendations are provided to reduce the variability and errors in data collection, analysis, and interpretation. The goal of this CORP is to provide readers with a greater understanding of the methodology, limitations, and best practices so as to improve the reproducibility of NIRS research in skeletal muscle.},

This is a fundamental question in the new interdisciplinary field of Network Physiology, and has not been previously explored. Introducing the novel concept of Time Delay Stability (TDS), we develop a computational approach to identify and quantify networks of physiologic interactions from long-term continuous, multi-channel physiological recordings. We also develop a physiologically-motivated visualization framework to map networks of dynamical organ interactions to graphical objects encoded with information about the coupling strength of network links quantified using the TDS measure. Applying a system-wide integrative approach, we identify distinct patterns in the network structure of organ interactions, as well as the frequency bands through which these interactions are mediated. We establish first maps representing physiologic organ network interactions and discover basic rules underlying the complex hierarchical reorganization in physiologic networks with transitions across physiologic states. Our findings demonstrate a direct association between network topology and physiologic function, and provide new insights into understanding how health and distinct physiologic states emerge from networked interactions among nonlinear multi-component complex systems. The presented here investigations are initial steps in building a first atlas of dynamic interactions among organ systems.},

For their work in discovering the distinction between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, Hill and Meyerhof were jointly awarded the 1922 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. Because of Hill's interest in athletics, he sought to apply the concepts discovered in isolated frog muscle to the exercising human. Hill and his colleagues made measurements of O2 consumption on themselves and other subjects running around an 85-m grass track. In the process of this work, they defined the terms ``maximum O2 intake,'' ``O2requirement,'' and ``steady state of exercise.'' Other contributions of Hill include his discoveries of heat production in nerve, the series elastic component, and the force-velocity equation in muscle. Around the time of World War II, Hill was a leading figure in the Academic Assistance Council, which helped Jewish scientists fleeing Nazi Germany to relocate in the West. He served as a member of the British Parliament from 1940 to 1945 and as a scientific advisor to India. Hill's vision and enthusiasm attracted many scientists to the field of exercise physiology, and he pointed the way toward many of the physiological adaptations that occur with physical training.},

Available commercial EMG sensor are expensive and not easily available for individuals. The aim of the study is to validate our designed low-cost sensor against a well-known commercial system for measuring muscle activity and fatigue assessment. The evaluation of the designed system was done through a series of dynamic exercises performed by volunteers. Our low-cost EMG sensor and the commercially available system were placed on the vastus lateralis muscle to concurrently record the signal in a maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). The signal analysis was done using two validation indicators: Spearman's correlation, and intra-class cross correlation on SPSS 26.0 version. For the muscle fatigue assessment, the root mean square (RMS), mean absolute value (MAV) and mean frequency (MNF) indicators were used. The results at the peak and mean level muscle contraction intensity were computed. The relative agreement for the two systems was excellent at peak level muscle contraction range (ICC 0.74\textendash 0.92), average 0.83 and mean level muscle contraction intensity range (ICC 0.65\textendash 0.85) with an average of 0.74. The Spearman's correlation average was 0.76 with the range of (0.71\textendash 0.85) at peak level contraction, whiles the mean level contraction average was 0.71 at a range of (0.62\textendash 0.81). In determining muscle fatigue, the RMS and MAV showed increasing values in the time domain, while the MEF decreased in the frequency domain. Overall, the results indicated a good to excellent agreement of the two systems and confirmed the reliability of our design. The low-cost sensor also proved to be suitable for muscle fatigue assessment. Our designed system can therefore be implemented for rehabilitation, sports science, and ergonomics.},

One testing session was preceded by 10 minutes of quiet sitting (C), 1 by a 30-minute lower-body stretching protocol (S), and 1 by 3 sets of a leg press exercise using 90\% of the subjects' previously determined 1 repetition maximum (P). Three repetitions were performed for each set of the leg press, with a 3-minute rest period between each set. PF during the isometric squat was not significantly different following any of the 3 conditions (C: 100.0 Ϯ 0.0\%, S: 101.2 Ϯ 6.5\%, P: 98.6 Ϯ 6.2\%). However, RFD was significantly lower in P (87.5 Ϯ 12.8\%) compared with both C (100.0 Ϯ 0.0\%) and S (102.6 Ϯ 18.5\%). Significant improvement in ROM occurred only following P. It appears the potentiation protocol used in the current investigation may actually have had fatiguing effects instead of potentiating effects, but it did result in significant increases in ROM.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to identify sites and mechanisms of long-term plasticity following lower limb muscle training. Two groups performing either a postural stability maintenance training (SMT) or a ballistic ankle strength training (BST) were compared to a non-training group. The hypothesis was that practicing of a self-initiated voluntary movement would facilitate cortico-spinal projections, while practicing fast automatic adjustments during stabilization of stance would reduce excitatory influence from the primary motor cortex. Training effects were expected to be confined to the practiced task. To test for training specificity, motor evoked potentials (MEP) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were recorded at rest and during motor tasks that were similar to each training. Intracortical, cortico-spinal, as well as spinal parameters were assessed at rest and during these tasks. The results show high task and training specificity. Training effects were only observable during performance of the trained task. While MEP size was decreased in the SMT group for the trained tasks, MEP recruitment was increased in the BST group in the trained task only. The control group did not show any changes. Background electromyogram levels, M. soleus H-reflex amplitudes and intracortical parameters were unaltered. In summary, it is suggested that the changes of MEP parameters in both training groups, but not in the control group, reflect cortical motor plasticity. While cortico-spinal activation was enhanced in the BST group, SMT may be associated with improved motor control through increased inhibitory trans-cortical effects. Since spinal excitability remained unaltered, changes most likely occur on the supraspinal level.},

Eleven men (mean {$\pm$} SD age = 22.4 {$\pm$} 1.1 years) and 7 women (mean {$\pm$} SD age = 22.7 {$\pm$} 2.1 years) performed 50 consecutive maximal concentric isokinetic muscle actions of the dominant leg extensors at a velocity of 180\textdegree{$\cdot$}s-1. During each muscle action, a bipolar surface EMG signal was detected from the vastus lateralis. All signals were then processed with a wavelet analysis designed specifically for EMG signals, which resulted in EMG intensity patterns. The patterns for each subject were then analyzed with a trend plot, which provided information regarding the changes that occurred because of fatigue. The results indicated that for all the 18 subjects, the EMG intensity patterns moved in a predictable manner in pattern space, but the changes to the patterns were different for each subject. These findings reflect the complex changes that occur in the EMG signal during fatigue. These changes cannot be characterized fully with a single amplitude and center frequency parameter and can be useful for athletes and coaches who need to track the fatigue status of individual muscles.},

Surface EMG signals were detected from the vastus lateralis, rectus femoris, and vastus medialis during each contraction, processed with a wavelet analysis, and the resulting spectra were decomposed with a nonparametric spectral decomposition procedure. Results: The results indicated that the decreases in EMG frequency during the 50 contractions were generally due to reductions in high-frequency power and increases in low-frequency power. In addition, the spectral shifts were most pronounced for the rectus femoris, followed by the vastus lateralis, and then the vastus medialis.

  abstract = {A common symptom in neuromuscular diseases is pain, which changes human movement in many ways. Using the decomposed electromyographic signal, we investigate the strategy of the brain in recruiting different pools of motor units (MUs) to produce torque during induced muscle pain in terms of firing rate (FR), recruitment threshold (RT) and action potential amplitude (MUAPAMP). These properties were used to define two groups (G1/G2) based on a K-means clusterization method. A 2.0 mL intramuscular hypertonic (6\%) or isotonic (0.9\%) saline solution was injected to induce pain or act as a placebo during isometric and isokinetic knee extension contractions. While isometric torque decreases after pain induction with hypertonic solution, this does not occur in isokinetic torque. This occurs because the MUs re-organized after the injection of both solutions. This is supported by an increase in RT, in both G1 and G2 MUs. However, when inducing pain with the hypertonic solution, RT increase is exacerbated. In this condition, FR also decreases, while MUAPAMP increases only for G1 MUs. Therefore, this study proposes that the strategy for maintaining force production during pain is to recruit MUs with higher RT and MUAPAMP.},

(Exp Brain Res 167:160\textendash 164, 2005). In the present study we have investigated whether this reduction is confined to motor areas or is more widespread. Functional imaging was performed before and after a 10-minute fatiguing exercise of the left hand (30\% of maximum handgrip strength) in seven normal subjects (4~M, mean age 25~years). The activating task was a handgrip against a low resistance (1~kg) in response to a visual cue (chequerboard reversal every 2~{$\pm~$}0.5~s). We compared activation in SM1, supplementary motor area (SMA), cerebellum (CB) and primary visual cortex (V1) before and after the fatiguing exercise. After exercise, contralateral SM1 activation was reduced by 33\% (P~{$<~$}0.05) compared to baseline for the fatigued hand and by 49\% for the non-fatigued hand (P~{$<~$}0.05). A similar pattern was seen for the bilateral SMA and ipsilateral CB following exercise (45 vs. 50\% for SMA; 30 vs. 35\% for CB; fatigued versus non-fatigued). Activation was also reduced in V1 but to a lesser extent than in motor areas (19 vs. 24\%; fatigued versus non-fatigued). These results show that although the reduced functional activation during the recovery period after fatiguing exercise is more marked in motor areas, it also extends to non-motor areas such as the visual cortex, suggesting that there are more widespread changes in cerebral haemodynamic responses after fatigue.},

A total of 120 recorded surface EMG signals, obtained by measurements on 12 different leg muscles of professional handball players performing countermovement jump, were analyzed using both algorithms. An experienced researcher visually determined onset/offset times and these were used as a reference. For each signal bias between evaluated algorithms and visual evaluation of muscle activity was calculated. The results indicate that the algorithm based on wavelets is more appropriate for the analysis of fast dynamic movements. Low level of background noise presented a problem whit establishment of an appropriate activity threshold. For the wavelet based algorithm this was dealt with by adding low level of white noise to the raw EMG signals. This procedure improved the validity of the activity threshold defined for EMG signals with low levels of background noise therefore improving the results of the algorithm. However, it does not solve the issue of inappropriate threshold when using the simple threshold based algorithm.},

Due to the distinction that exists between central and peripheral orchestration of movements, the physiology of the neuromuscular apparatus itself has been also included. In terms of text architecture and hodological relationships, the structure of this chapter corresponds to an ascending Jacksonian-type hierarchy from spinal cord through to cortex, since the aim was to convey a dynamic perspective, both in terms of the physiology of individual neurons and at the level of cortical and sub-cortical networks and their interconnecting circuitry. Special emphasis has been placed on such salient aspects as locomotor generation at the spinal level, kinesthesia, the coding of messages relating to motor performance in primary (motor and somatic-sensory) cortical regions and association cortices (premotor and supplementary motor, prefrontal and posterior parietal), the contribution of networks belonging to the basal ganglia in movement control, and the role of cerebellar circuitry in motor learning.},

Twenty-two young males were randomly assigned to a VL20 (n = 12) or VL40 (n = 10) group. Subjects followed an 8-week velocity-based RT program using the squat exercise while monitoring repetition velocity. Pre- and post-training assessments included: magnetic resonance imaging, vastus lateralis biopsies for muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and fiber type analyses, one-repetition maximum strength and full load-velocity squat profile, countermovement jump (CMJ), and 20-m sprint running. VL20 resulted in similar squat strength gains than VL40 and greater improvements in CMJ (9.5\% vs 3.5\%, P {$<$} 0.05), despite VL20 performing 40\% fewer repetitions. Although both groups increased mean fiber CSA and whole quadriceps muscle volume, VL40 training elicited a greater hypertrophy of vastus lateralis and intermedius than VL20. Training resulted in a reduction of myosin heavy chain IIX percentage in VL40, whereas it was preserved in VL20. In conclusion, the progressive accumulation of muscle fatigue as indicated by a more pronounced repetition velocity loss appears as an important variable in the configuration of the resistance exercise stimulus as it influences functional and structural neuromuscular adaptations.},

A higher activation is expected in the contralateral motor cortex (M1) but consensus has not yet been reached.

Nine healthy participants performed in a randomized order three sets of five repetitions of eccentric or concentric movement with the dominant elbow flexors over a range of motion of 60\textdegree{} at two velocities (30\textdegree/s and 60\textdegree/s). The tests were carried out using a Biodex isokinetic dynamometer with the forearm supported in the horizontal plane. The peak torque values were not significantly different between concentric and eccentric movements (p = 0.42). Hemodynamic responses of the contralateral and ipsilateral M1 were measured with a near-infrared spectroscopy system (Oxymon MkIII, Artinis). A higher contralateral M1 activity was found during eccentric movements (p = 0.04, {$\eta^2$} = 0.47) and at the velocity of 30\textdegree/s (p = 0.039, {$\eta^2$} = 0.48). These preliminary findings indicate a specific control mechanism in the contralateral M1 to produce eccentric muscle actions at the angular velocities investigated, although the role of other brain areas in the motor control network cannot be excluded.},

  abstract = {When listening to music, humans can easily identify and move to the beat. Numerous experimental studies have identified brain regions that may be involved with beat perception and representation. Several theoretical and algorithmic approaches have been proposed to account for this ability. Related to, but different from the issue of how we perceive a beat, is the question of how we learn to generate and hold a beat. In this paper, we introduce a neuronal framework for a beat generator that is capable of learning isochronous rhythms over a range of frequencies that are relevant to music and speech. Our approach combines ideas from error-correction and entrainment models to investigate the dynamics of how a biophysically-based neuronal network model synchronizes its period and phase to match that of an external stimulus. The model makes novel use of on-going faster gamma rhythms to form a set of discrete clocks that provide estimates, but not exact information, of how well the beat generator spike times match those of a stimulus sequence. The beat generator is endowed with plasticity allowing it to quickly learn and thereby adjust its spike times to achieve synchronization. Our model makes generalizable predictions about the existence of asymmetries in the synchronization process, as well as specific predictions about resynchronization times after changes in stimulus tempo or phase. Analysis of the model demonstrates that accurate rhythmic time keeping can be achieved over a range of frequencies relevant to music, in a manner that is robust to changes in parameters and to the presence of noise.},

  abstract = {While the effects of exercise on brain cortical activity from pre-to post-exercise have been thoroughly evaluated, few studies have investigated the change in activity during exercise. As such, it is not clear to what extent changes in exercise intensity influence brain cortical activity. Furthermore, due to the difficulty in using brain-imaging methods during complex whole-body movements like cycling, it is unclear to what extent the activity in specific brain areas is altered with incremental exercise intensity over time. Latterly, active electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes combined with source localization methods allow for the assessment of brain activity, measured as EEG current density, within specific cortical regions. The present study aimed to investigate the application of this method during exercise on a cycle ergometer, and to investigate the effect of increasing exercise intensity on the magnitude and location of any changes in electrocortical current density. Subjects performed an incremental cycle ergometer test until subjective exhaustion. Current density of the EEG recordings during each test stage, as well as before and after exercise, was determined. Spatial changes in current density were localized using low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) to three regions of interest; the primary motor cortex, primary sensory cortex and prefrontal cortex, and were expressed relative to current density within the local lobe. It was demonstrated that the relative current density of the primary motor cortex was intensified with increasing exercise intensity, whereas activity of the primary sensory cortex and that of the prefrontal cortex were not altered with exercise. The results indicate that the combined active EEG/LORETA method allows for the recording of brain cortical activity during complex movements and incremental exercise. These findings indicate that primary motor cortex activity is elevated with incremental exercise intensity during a whole-body movement, like cycling.},

  abstract = {Given that an effect size of d = .4 is a good first estimate of the smallest effect size of interest in psychological research, we already need over 50 participants for a simple comparison of two within-participants conditions if we want to run a study with 80\% power. This is more than current practice. In addition, as soon as a between-groups variable or an interaction is involved, numbers of 100, 200, and even more participants are needed. As long as we do not accept these facts, we will keep on running underpowered studies with unclear results. Addressing the issue requires a change in the way research is evaluated by supervisors, examiners, reviewers, and editors. The present paper describes reference numbers needed for the designs most often used by psychologists, including single-variable between-groups and repeated-measures designs with two and three levels, two-factor designs involving two repeated-measures variables or one between-groups variable and one repeated-measures variable (split-plot design). The numbers are given for the traditional, frequentist analysis with p {$<$} .05 and Bayesian analysis with BF {$>$} 10. These numbers provide researchers with a standard to determine (and justify) the sample size of an upcoming study. The article also describes how researchers can improve the power of their study by including multiple observations per condition per participant.},

After the explosion of an oxygen tank, however, the astronauts were close to spending the rest of their lives in rotation around the planet. This well-known incident is used to further discuss the link, or lack thereof, between sport-science research and current field practices. There is a feeling that the academic culture and its publishing requirements have created a bit of an Apollo 13\textendash like orbiting world (eg, journals and conferences) that is mostly disconnected from the reality of elite performance. The author discusses how poor research discredits our profession and provides some examples from the field where the research does not apply. In fact, the reality is that sport scientists often do not have the right answers. Some perspectives to improve translation are finally discussed, including a rethink of the overall publishing process: promotion of relevant submission types (eg, short-paper format, short reports, as provided by IJSPP), improvement of the review process (faster turnaround, reviewers identified to increase accountability, and, in turn, review quality), and media types (eg, free downloads, simplified versions published in coaching journals, book chapters, infographics, dissemination via social media). When it comes to guiding practitioners and athletes, instead of using an evidence-based approach, we should rather promote an ``evidence-led'' or ``informed-practice'' approach\textemdash one that appreciates context over simple scientific conclusions.},

To date, the concept of personalized medicine has referred largely to the field of pharmacogenomics. In contrast, relatively few data exist regarding the application of preventive strategies such as physical exercise in the context of personalized medicine. Within this review, we highlight the extant literature and propose five strategies for scientists that may propel the exercise and sports science fields toward this global goal. Notably, these approaches are in addition to methods to maintain adherence to training \textendash{} a well-known factor in determining exercise responsiveness. Briefly, these strategies include (1) evaluating participant responses to training at the individual as well as group level; (2) identifying sources of variability in responsiveness to training; (3) optimizing exercise dosing strategies to maximize benefits while minimizing barriers to participation; (4) evaluating the efficacy of multimodal interventions for relevant population subgroups; and (5) increasing the clinical relevance of study populations and outcomes in exercise trials. We look forward to seeing these strategies considered in trials of preventive health interventions such as exercise. Extensive future research in this area is needed for the vision of exercise as a personalized form of medicine to become a reality.},

  abstract = {The structures of musical rhythm differ between cultures, despite the fact that the ability to entrain movement to musical rhythm occurs in virtually all individuals across cultures. To measure the influence of culture on rhythm processing, we tested East African and North American adults on perception, production, and beat tapping for rhythms derived from East African and Western music. To assess rhythm perception, participants identified whether pairs of rhythms were the same or different. To assess rhythm production, participants reproduced rhythms after hearing them. To assess beat tapping, participants tapped the beat along with repeated rhythms. We expected that performance in all three tasks would be influenced by the culture of the participant and the culture of the rhythm. Specifically, we predicted that a participant's ability to discriminate, reproduce, and accurately tap the beat would be better for rhythms from their own culture than for rhythms from another culture. In the rhythm discrimination task, there were no differences in discriminating culturally familiar and unfamiliar rhythms. In the rhythm reproduction task, both groups reproduced East African rhythms more accurately than Western rhythms, but East African participants also showed an effect of cultural familiarity, leading to a significant interaction. In the beat tapping task, participants in both groups tapped the beat more accurately for culturally familiar than for unfamiliar rhythms. Moreover, there were differences between the two participant groups, and between the two types of rhythms, in the metrical level selected for beat tapping. The results demonstrate that culture does influence the processing of musical rhythm. In terms of the function of musical rhythm, our results are consistent with theories that musical rhythm enables synchronization. Musical rhythm may foster musical cultural identity by enabling within-group synchronization to music, perhaps supporting social cohesion.},

  abstract = {Recent studies on the functional organization and operational principles of the motor cortex (MCx), taken together, strongly support the notion that the MCx controls the muscle synergies subserving movements in an integrated manner. For example, during pointing the shoulder, elbow and wrist muscles appear to be controlled as a coupled functional system, rather than singly and separately. The recurrent pattern of intrinsic synaptic connections between motor cortical points is likely part of the explanation for this operational principle. So too is the reduplicated, non-contiguous and intermingled representation of muscles in the MCx. A key question addressed in this article is whether the selection of movement related muscle synergies is a dynamic process involving the moment to moment functional linking of a variety of motor cortical points, or rather the selection of fixed patterns embedded in the MCx circuitry. It will be suggested that both operational principles are probably involved. We also discuss the neural mechanisms by which cortical points may be dynamically linked to synthesize movement related muscle synergies. Separate corticospinal outputs sum linearly and lead to a blending of the movements evoked by activation of each point on its own. This operational principle may simplify the synthesis of motor commands. We will discuss two possible mechanisms that may explain linear summation of outputs. We have observed that the final posture of the arm when pointing to a given spatial location is relatively independent of its starting posture. From this observation and the recurrent nature of the MCx intrinsic connectivity we hypothesize that the basic mode of operation of the MCx is to associate spatial location to final arm posture. We explain how the recurrent network connectivity operates to generate the muscle activation patterns (synergies) required to move the arm and hold it in its final position.},

The aim of the present study was to investigate the hemodynamic responses within sensorimotor networks as well as in visual motion area during the execution of a complex visuomotor task such as juggling. More specifically, we were interested in how far the hemodynamic response as measured with functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) adapts as a function of task complexity and the level of the juggling expertise. We asked expert jugglers to perform different juggling tasks with different levels of complexity such as a 2-ball juggling, 3- and 5-ball juggling cascades. We here demonstrate that expert jugglers show an altered neurovascular response with increasing task complexity, since a 5-ball juggling cascade showed enhanced hemodynamic responses for oxygenated hemoglobin as compared to less complex tasks such as a 3- or 2-ball juggling pattern. Moreover, correlations between the hemodynamic response and the level of the juggling expertise during the 5-ball juggling cascade, acquired by cinematographic video analysis, revealed only a non-significant trend in primary motor cortex, indicating that a higher level of expertise might be associated with lower hemodynamic responses.},

  abstract = {Bouldering is a special form of climbing without rope that requires coordinated whole-body movements. While physical performance parameters such as condition have been well studied, the knowledge on neural activity during climbing still remains sparse. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) allows to measure brain activation while performing sportive actions due to its relative robustness against motion artefacts. In the current study, hemodynamic response alterations of 13 advanced climbers were investigated during boulder performance using fNIRS measurements. Simple and moderate climbing routes were compared regarding their level of cortical activation mainly in the sensorimotor area. Our results show that repetitively climbing a set of boulders activates almost all areas of the sensorimotor system including the bilateral premotor and supplementary motor cortex, bilateral primary motor cortex as well as the bilateral gyrus supramarginalis and somatosensory cortex. This result was found in both simple and moderate climbing routes with no effect of task complexity on the level of cortical activity. Correlation analysis (uncorrected for multiple comparisons) revealed a negative association between the level of expertise and the hemodynamic response in the supplementary-motor region, suggesting that gaining expertise in climbing is associated with a decrease in secondary motor areas, which is an indicator of motor automaticity. In summary, the present study provides first proof of concept that fNIRS is capable of assessing hemodynamic response alterations within the human motor system during the execution of complex whole-body climbing movements.},

Hence, we aimed at investigating hemodynamic response alterations during a basketball slalom dribbling task (BSDT) using multi-distance functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in 23 participants (12 females). Additionally, we quantified how the brain adapts its processing as a function of altered hand use (dominant right hand (DH) vs. non-dominant left hand (NDH) vs. alternating hands (AH)) and pace of execution (slow vs. fast) in BSDT. We found that BSDT activated bilateral premotor cortex (PMC), supplementary motor cortex (SMA), primary motor cortex (M1) as well as inferior parietal cortex and somatosensory association cortex. Slow dominant hand dribbling (DHslow) evoked lower contralateral hemodynamic responses in sensorimotor regions compared to fast dribbling (DHfast). Furthermore, during DHslow dribbling, we found lower hemodynamic responses in ipsilateral M1 as compared to dribbling with alternating hands (AHslow). Hence, altered task complexity during BSDT induced differential hemodynamic response patterns. Furthermore, a correlation analysis revealed that lower levels of perceived task complexity are associated with lower hemodynamic responses in ipsilateral PMC-SMA, which is an indicator for neuronal efficiency in participants with better basketball dribbling skills. The present study extends previous findings by showing that varying levels of task complexity are reflected by specific hemodynamic response alterations even during sports-relevant motor behavior. Taken together, we suggest that quantifying brain activation during complex movements is a prerequisite for assessing brain-behavior relations and optimizing motor performance.},

With the present study, we aimed to uncover aspects of this role by examining modulatory differences in brain processing as a function of expertise and task complexity in table tennis. For this purpose, 28 right-handed volunteers (14 experts and 14 novices) performed two table tennis strokes in a standardized manner. Hemodynamic response alterations reflecting neuronal activation were recorded during task execution using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and analyzed within and between groups. Our results showed localized activation patterns in motor areas (primary motor cortex (M1), premotor cortex (PMC), and inferior parietal cortex (IPC)) for experts and novices. Compared to novices, experts completed more table tennis strokes and showed a significant increase in hemodynamic response alterations in channels corresponding to motor areas. Furthermore, we found significant correlations between the number of strokes and hemodynamic response magnitudes in individual channels of M1, PMC, and IPC. Taken together, our findings show that table tennis performance is accompanied by extensive activation of M1, PMC, and IPC. Further, the observed difference in behavioral performance between experts and novices was associated with increased activation in M1, PMC, and IPC. We postulate that these differences in brain processing between experts and novices potentially imply modulatory distinctions related to increased movement speed or frequency but may also reflect an increased task familiarity of the experts.},

  abstract = {Although it has long been supposed that resistance training causes adaptive changes in the CNS, the sites and nature of these adaptations have not previously been identified. In order to determine whether the neural adaptations to resistance training occur to a greater extent at cortical or subcortical sites in the CNS, we compared the effects of resistance training on the electromyographic (EMG) responses to transcranial magnetic (TMS) and electrical (TES) stimulation. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle of 16 individuals before and after 4 weeks of resistance training for the index finger abductors (n= 8), or training involving finger abduction-adduction without external resistance (n= 8). TMS was delivered at rest at intensities from 5 \% below the passive threshold to the maximal output of the stimulator. TMS and TES were also delivered at the active threshold intensity while the participants exerted torques ranging from 5 to 60 \% of their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) torque. The average latency of MEPs elicited by TES was significantly shorter than that of TMS MEPs (TES latency = 21.5 {$\pm$} 1.4 ms; TMS latency = 23.4 {$\pm$} 1.4 ms; P {$<$} 0.05), which indicates that the site of activation differed between the two forms of stimulation. Training resulted in a significant increase in MVC torque for the resistance-training group, but not the control group. There were no statistically significant changes in the corticospinal properties measured at rest for either group. For the active trials involving both TMS and TES, however, the slope of the relationship between MEP size and the torque exerted was significantly lower after training for the resistance-training group (P {$<$} 0.05). Thus, for a specific level of muscle activity, the magnitude of the EMG responses to both forms of transcranial stimulation were smaller following resistance training. These results suggest that resistance training changes the functional properties of spinal cord circuitry in humans, but does not substantially affect the organisation of the motor cortex.},

There are now many published reports that have used single motor unit recordings, electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves, and non-invasive stimulation of the human brain [i.e. transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)] to study neural responses to strength training. In this review, we aim to summarize what has been learned from single motor unit, reflex and TMS studies, and identify the most promising avenues to advance our conceptual understanding with these methods. We also consider the few strength training studies that have employed alternative neurophysiological techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography. The nature of the information that these techniques can provide, as well as their major technical and conceptual pitfalls, are briefly described. The overall conclusion of the review is that the current evidence regarding neural adaptations to strength training is inconsistent and incomplete. In order to move forward in our understanding, it will be necessary to design studies that are based on a rigorous consideration of the limitations of the available techniques, and that are specifically targeted to address important conceptual questions.},

  abstract = {We describe a novel spatial filtering approach to the localization of cortical activity accompanying voluntary movements. The synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) minimum-variance beamformer algorithm was used to compute spatial filters three-dimensionally over the entire brain from single trial neuromagnetic recordings of subjects performing self-paced index finger movements. Images of instantaneous source power (``event-related SAM'') computed at selected latencies revealed activation of multiple cortical motor areas prior to and following left and right index finger movements in individual subjects, even in the presence of low-frequency noise (e.g., eye movements). A slow premovement motor field (MF) reaching maximal amplitude {$\sim$}50 ms prior to movement onset was localized to the hand area of contralateral precentral gyrus, followed by activity in the contralateral postcentral gyrus at 40 ms, corresponding to the first movement-evoked field (MEFI). A novel finding was a second activation of the precentral gyrus at a latency of {$\sim$}150 ms, corresponding to the second movement-evoked field (MEFII). Group averaging of spatially normalized images indicated additional premovement activity in the ipsilateral precentral gyrus and the left inferior parietal cortex for both left and right finger movements. Weaker activations were also observed in bilateral premotor areas and the supplementary motor area. These results show that event-related beamforming provides a robust method for studying complex patterns of time-locked cortical activity accompanying voluntary movements, and offers a new approach for the localization of multiple cortical sources derived from neuromagnetic recordings in single subject and group data.

The power spectrum of the EMG shifts towards lower frequencies during a continued muscle contraction due to muscular fatigue. Muscle fatigue is the decline in ability of a muscle to create force. This research presents the effectiveness of the wavelet transform applied to the surface EMG (SEMG) signal as a means of understanding muscle fatigue during walk. Power spectrum and bispectrum analysis on the EMG signal getting from right rectus femoris muscle is executed utilizing various wavelet functions (WFs). It is possible to recognize muscle fatigue appreciably with the proper choice of the WF. The outcome proves that, the most momentous changes in the EMG power spectrum symbolized by WF Daubechies4.

  abstract = {Assessment of neuromuscular fatigue is essential for early detection and prevention of risks associated with work-related musculoskeletal disorders. In recent years, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) of surface electromyography (SEMG) has been used to evaluate muscle fatigue, especially during dynamic contractions when the SEMG signal is non-stationary. However, its application to the assessment of work-related neck and shoulder muscle fatigue is not well established. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to establish DWT analysis as a suitable method to conduct quantitative assessment of neck and shoulder muscle fatigue under dynamic repetitive conditions. Ten human participants performed 40min of fatiguing repetitive arm and neck exertions while SEMG data from the upper trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles were recorded. The ten of the most commonly used wavelet functions were used to conduct the DWT analysis. Spectral changes estimated using power of wavelet coefficients in the 12\textendash 23Hz frequency band showed the highest sensitivity to fatigue induced by the dynamic repetitive exertions. Although most of the wavelet functions tested in this study reasonably demonstrated the expected power trend with fatigue development and recovery, the overall performance of the ``Rbio3.1'' wavelet in terms of power estimation and statistical significance was better than the remaining nine wavelets.},

  abstract = {In the last three decades it has become quite common to evaluate local muscle fatigue by means of surface electromyographic (sEMG) signal processing. A large number of studies have been performed yielding signal-based quantitative criteria of fatigue in primarily static but also in dynamic tasks. The non-invasive nature of this approach has been particularly appealing in areas like ergonomics and occupational biomechanics, to name just the most prominent ones. However, a correct appreciation of the findings concerned can only be obtained by judging both the scientific value and practical utility of methods while appreciating the corresponding advantages and limitations. The aim of this paper is to serve as a state of the art summary of this issue. The paper gives an overview of classical and modern signal processing methods and techniques from the standpoint of applicability to sEMG signals in fatigue-inducing situations relevant to the broad field of biomechanics. Time domain, frequency domain, time\textendash frequency and time-scale representations, and other methods such as fractal analysis and recurrence quantification analysis are described succinctly and are illustrated with their biomechanical applications, research or clinical alike. Examples from the authors' own work are incorporated where appropriate. The future of this methodology is projected by estimating those methods that have the greatest chance to be routinely used as reliable muscle fatigue measures.},

The loaded barbell squat is widely used and central to many strength training programs. It is a functional and safe exercise that is obviously transferable to many movements in sports and life. Hence, a large and growing body of research has been published on various aspects of the squat. Training studies have measured the impact of barbell squat loading schemes on selected training adaptations including maximal strength and power changes in the squat. Squat exercise training adaptations and their impact on a variety of performance parameters, in particular countermovement jump, acceleration, and running speed, have also been reported. Furthermore, studies have reported on the muscle activation of the lower limb resulting from variations of squat depth, foot placement, training status, and training intensity. There have also been studies on the impact of squatting with or without a weight belt on trunk muscle activation (TMA). More recently, studies have reported on the effect of instability on TMA and squat performance. Research has also shown that muscle activation of the prime movers in the squat exercise increases with an increase in the external load. Also common variations such as stance width, hip rotation, and front squat do not significantly affect muscle activation. However, despite many studies, this information has not been consolidated, resulting in a lack of consensus about how the information can be applied. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to examine studies that reported muscle activation measured by electromyography in the free barbell back squat with the goal of clarifying the understanding of how the exercise can be applied.},

METHODS: Sixty-seven individuals (55-75~years old) volunteered for this 16-week intervention study. Participants were randomized into a resistance training (RT) group (n~=~22), high-intensity interval training (HIIT) group (n~=~13), moderate continuous training (MCT) group (n~=~13) and a control (CON) group (n~=~19). Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure cerebral oxygenation during the Stroop task. A submaximal Bruce treadmill test was used to measure changes in walking endurance. RESULTS: The GROUP~\texttimes ~TIME interaction for reaction time on the naming and executive Stroop conditions were not significant (P~{$>~$}0.05). At post-test, the CON group showed increased brain activation, with significantly higher relative oxy-haemoglobin (O2Hb) values during the naming Stroop condition compared to pre-test (P~=~0.03), while their increased relative O2Hb on the complex condition showed a distinct trend toward significance (P~=~0.09). MCT and HIIT participants exhibited decreased brain activation during the Stroop task, with MCT showing a significant increase in relative deoxy-haemoglobin (HHb) compared to pre-test during the naming and executive Stroop conditions (P~{$<~$}0.05). The HIIT group improved significantly in walking endurance (P~=~0.04). CONCLUSION: Sixteen weeks of exercise training resulted in more efficient cerebral oxygenation during cortical activation compared to a no-exercise control group. Furthermore, HIIT and MCT were superior to RT for task-efficient cerebral oxygenation and improved oxygen utilization during cortical activation in older individuals.},

The technique was used to study the relationship between VO2 in the soleus muscle and the level of isometric exercise expressed as percentages of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). For the study 11 healthy male volunteers were recruited. Reproducibility was studied in 6 subjects. The subjects were seated in a chair with the knee joint at an angle of 90\textdegree. The optodes of the NIRS instrument were attached to the lateral aspect of the soleus muscle. A horizontal bar above the knee was connected to a dynamometer. Subjects applied isometric force to the bar by producing a torque at the ankle joint. Firstly the MVC was determined. Secondly the VO2 at rest and at 5 levels of isometric exercise, ranging from 5\% to 25\% of MVC and increasing by 5\% each stage, was measured. In all cases the VO2 at rest or during isometric contraction was determined from the decrease of the oxyhaemoglobin (O2Hb) signal immediately after arterial occlusion of the thigh. Repeated measurements showed no significant difference between trials, indicating that the measurements were reproducible. At rest a VO2 of 6.7 {$\pm$} 1.1 {$\mu$}MO2Hb min-1 (mean {$\pm$} S.E.M.) was found, a result comparable with other studies. In all subjects a linear relationship was found between the VO2 and the level of exercise. The average slope of the regression lines of all individuals was 0.85 {$\pm$} 0.22 {$\mu$}uMO, Hb min-1 MVC-1 (mean {$\pm$} S.E.M.). Inter-individual variation of the slopes was high and ranged from 0.28 to 2.29 {$\mu$}uMO2 Hb- min-1 \%MVC-1, which can be explained by differences in fat percentage and in the measuring volume of the NIRS instrument. NIRS appeared to be a reproducible and reliable method for the non-invasive measurement of VO2 in human muscles. The method could be used to investigate regional differences as well as changes in time between muscle groups as a function of training.},

We show that motor-evoked potential generated by transcranial magnetic stimulation but not cervicomedullary electrical stimulation increased in proportion to the intensity of training used during a single session of RT.

Before and after each session separated at least by 1~week, motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude, short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), contralateral silent period (SP), and intracortical facilitation (ICF) generated by TMS were measured in the trained and the untrained BBs. Compared with baseline, MEPs recorded from the trained BB increased by \textasciitilde 47\% after training at 75\% of MVC (P~{$<~$}.05) but not after training at 0\% (\textasciitilde 4\%) or 25\% MVC (\textasciitilde 5\%, both P~{$>~$}.05). MEPs in the untrained BB and SICI, SP, and ICF in either BB did not change. Therefore, acute high-intensity but not low-intensity unilateral isometric ST increases CSE in the trained BB without modifications in intracortical inhibition or facilitation. Thus, increases in corticospinal neurons or {$\alpha$}-{$\alpha$}-motoneuron excitability could underlie the increases in CSE. Regardless of contraction intensity, acute isometric ST did not modify the excitability of the ipsilateral primary motor cortex measured by TMS.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Unilateral resistance training has been shown to improve muscle strength in both the trained and the untrained limb. One of the most widely accepted theories is that this improved performance is due to nervous system adaptations, specifically in the primary motor cortex. According to this hypothesis, increased corticospinal excitability (CSE), measured with transcranial magnetic stimulation, is one of the main adaptations observed following prolonged periods of training. The principal aim of this review is to determine the degree of adaptation of CSE and its possible functional association with increased strength in the untrained limb. DEVELOPMENT: We performed a systematic literature review of studies published between January 1970 and December 2016, extracted from Medline (via PubMed), Ovid, Web of Science, and Science Direct online databases. The search terms were as follows: (transcranial magnetic stimulation OR excitability) AND (strength training OR resistance training OR force) AND (cross transfer OR contralateral limb OR cross education). A total of 10 articles were found. CONCLUSION: Results regarding increased CSE were inconsistent. Although the possibility that the methodology had a role in this inconsistency cannot be ruled out, the results appear to suggest that there may not be a functional association between increases in muscle strength and in CSE.},

  abstract = {Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is susceptible to signal artifacts caused by relative motion between NIRS optical fibers and the scalp. These artifacts can be very damaging to the utility of functional NIRS, particularly in challenging subject groups where motion can be unavoidable. A number of approaches to the removal of motion artifacts from NIRS data have been suggested. In this paper we systematically compare the utility of a variety of published NIRS motion correction techniques using a simulated functional activation signal added to 20 real NIRS datasets which contain motion artifacts. Principle component analysis, spline interpolation, wavelet analysis, and Kalman filtering approaches are compared to one another and to standard approaches using the accuracy of the recovered, simulated hemodynamic response function (HRF). Each of the four motion correction techniques we tested yields a significant reduction in the mean-squared error (MSE) and significant increase in the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the recovered HRF when compared to no correction and compared to a process of rejecting motion-contaminated trials. Spline interpolation produces the largest average reduction in MSE (55\%) while wavelet analysis produces the highest average increase in CNR (39\%). On the basis of this analysis, we recommend the routine application of motion correction techniques (particularly spline interpolation or wavelet analysis) to minimize the impact of motion artifacts on functional NIRS data.},

Twenty healthy subjects participated in the study after giving their informed consent.

The normalized surface electromyographic root-mean-square (sEMG RMS) amplitude of gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, adductor longus, longissimus, and iliocostalis was recorded during both the ascending and descending phase of each exercise. During the descending phase, greater sEMG RMS amplitude of gluteus maximus and gluteus medius was found in FS vs. all other exercises (p {$<$} 0.05). Additionally, FS elicited iliocostalis more than all other exercises. During the ascending phase, both sumo-BS and external-rotated-sumo-BS showed greater vastus lateralis and adductor longus activation compared to all other exercises (p {$<$} 0.05). Moreover, rectus femoris activation was greater in FS compared to full-BS (p {$<$} 0.05). No between-exercise difference was found in vastus medialis and longissimus showed no between-exercise difference. FS needs more backward stabilization during the descending phase. Larger feet-stance increases thigh muscles activity, possibly because of their longer length. These findings show how bodybuilders uniquely recruit muscles when performing different squat variations.},

Changes in muscle deoxygenation during squat exercise after 6-week resistance training with different percentages of velocity loss. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000\textendash 000, 2022\textemdash The present study compared, for the first time, the effects of 6 weeks of 20\% (20VL) vs. 40\% (40VL) velocity loss (VL) resistance training (RT) programs on muscle oxygen dynamics during the squat exercise. Twenty-three young men (21.4 {$\pm$} 2.4 years) were randomly allocated into the 20VL group (n = 8), 40VL group (n = 7), or control group (CG; n = 8). The RT program consisted of 3 sets of Smith machine back squat exercise at 20VL or 40VL with a 3-minute rest between sets, twice per week for 6 weeks. Tissue oxygenation index (TOI) was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy in the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis during a squat test (8-repetition 1 m{$\cdot$}s-1 load test), and the maximum (maxTOI) and minimum (minTOI) TOIs were measured during a 3-min recovery period. After the 6-week RT program, TOI increased significantly at the beginning of the test in both muscles (during the first 4 repetitions in the vastus lateralis and 5 repetitions in the vastus medialis) in the 20VL group (p {$<$} 0.05), with nonsignificant changes in the 40VL group and CG. The maxTOI was significantly increased in the vastus medialis (+3.76\%) and vastus lateralis (+3.97\%) after the training only in the 20VL group (p {$<$} 0.05). The minTOI in the vastus medialis reached during the test remained unchanged postintervention for both training groups, with the CG showing significantly higher values compared with the 20VL group (+14.1\%; p {$<$} 0.05). In conclusion, depending on the VL reached during a squat RT program, different changes in muscle oxygen dynamics can be expected. Training at 20\% of VL improves metabolic efficiency and the reoxygenation peak after the set.},

A search of multiple databases was undertaken. Included studies must have investigated a sport-specific movement and analysed via machine or deep learning methods for model development. A total of 52 studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data pre-processing, processing, model development and evaluation methods varied across the studies. Model development for movement recognition were predominantly undertaken using supervised classification approaches. A kernel form of the Support Vector Machine algorithm was used in 53\% of IMU and 50\% of vision-based studies. Twelve studies used a deep learning method as a form of Convolutional Neural Network algorithm and one study also adopted a Long Short Term Memory architecture in their model. The adaptation of experimental set-up, data pre-processing, and model development methods are best considered in relation to the characteristics of the targeted sports movement(s).},

We designed a system that could record joint force and surface EMG online with fMRI data. High-quality force and EMG data were obtained while maintaining the quality of the fMRI brain images. Using this system, we determined the relationship between fMRI-measured brain activation and handgrip force and between fMRI-measured brain signal and EMG of extrinsic finger muscles. Ten volunteers participated in the experiments (only seven subjects' data were analyzed due to excessive noise in the fMRI data of three subjects). The participants exerted 20\%, 35\%, 50\%, 65\%, and 80\% of the maximal force. During each contraction period, handgrip force, surface EMG of the finger flexor and extensor muscles, and fMRI brain images were acquired. The degree of muscle activation (force and EMG) was directly proportional to the amplitude of the brain signal determined by fMRI in the entire brain and in a number of motor function-related cortical fields, including primary motor, sensory regions, supplementary motor area, premotor, prefrontal, parietal and cingulate cortices, and cerebellum. All the examined brain areas demonstrated a similar relationship between the fMRI signal and force. A stronger fMRI signal during higher force indicates that more cortical output neurons and/or interneurons may participate in generating descending commands and/or processing additional sensory information. The similarity in the relationship between muscle output and fMRI signal in the cortical regions suggests that correlated or networked activation among a number of cortical fields may be necessary for controlling precise static force of finger muscles.},

Hypothesis A simple gait test will detect differences between different knee pathologies. Material and methods Forty-seven patients with bilateral knee OA, 47~patients with DML, 28~patients with SONK and 27~healthy controls were included in this analysis. Patients underwent a spatiotemporal gait assessment and were asked to complete the Western Ontario and McMaster university (WOMAC) Index and the Short-Form (SF)-36 Health Survey. Anova tests, followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison tests and the Chi2 tests were performed for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Results Significant differences were found for all gait measures and clinical questionnaires between healthy controls and all knee conditions. Patients with SONK differed from patients with bilateral knee OA and DML in all gait measures and clinical questionnaires, except for WOMAC subscales. There were no significant differences between patients with bilateral knee OA and patients with DML. Symmetry was also examined and revealed asymmetry in some gait parameters in patients with SONK and DML. Discussion Based on the differences in gait parameters that were found in the current study, adding an objective functional spatiotemporal gait test may assist in the diagnostic process of knee pathologies.

  abstract = {Because rate of force development (RFD) is an emerging outcome measure for the assessment of neuromuscular function in unfatigued conditions, and it represents a valid alternative/complement to the classical evaluation of pure maximal strength, this scoping review aimed to map the available evidence regarding RFD as an indicator of neuromuscular fatigue. Thus, following a general overview of the main studies published on this topic, we arbitrarily compared the amount of neuromuscular fatigue between the "gold standard" measure (maximal voluntary force, MVF) and peak, early ({$\leq$}100 ms) and late ({$>$}100 ms) RFD. Seventy full-text articles were included in the review. The most-common fatiguing exercises were resistance exercises (37\% of the studies), endurance exercises/locomotor activities (23\%), isokinetic contractions (17\%), and simulated/real sport situations (13\%). The most widely tested tasks were knee extension (60\%) and plantar flexion (10\%). The reason (i.e., rationale) for evaluating RFD was lacking in 36\% of the studies. On average, the amount of fatigue for MVF (-19\%) was comparable to late RFD (-19\%) but lower compared to both peak RFD (-25\%) and early RFD (-23\%). Even if the rationale for evaluating RFD in the fatigued state was often lacking and the specificity between test task and fatiguing exercise characteristics was not always respected in the included studies, RFD seems to be a valid indicator of neuromuscular fatigue. Based on our arbitrary analyses, peak RFD and early phase RFD appear even to be more sensitive to quantify neuromuscular fatigue than MVF and late phase RFD.},

  abstract = {Most human phenotypes are influenced by a combination of genomic and environmental factors. Engaging in regular physical exercise prevents many chronic diseases, decreases mortality risk and increases longevity. However, the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. The modulating effect of physical (aerobic and resistance) exercise on gene expression has been known for some time now and has provided us with an understanding of the biological responses to physical exercise. Emerging research data suggest that epigenetic modifications are extremely important for both development and disease in humans. In the current review, we summarise findings on the effect of exercise on epigenetic modifications and their effects on gene expression. Current research data suggest epigenetic modifications (DNA methylation and histone acetylation) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are responsive to acute aerobic and resistance exercise in brain, blood, skeletal and cardiac muscle, adipose tissue and even buccal cells. Six months of aerobic exercise alters whole-genome DNA methylation in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and directly influences lipogenesis. Some miRNAs are related to maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) and VO2max trainability, and are differentially expressed amongst individuals with high and low VO2max. Remarkably, miRNA expression profiles discriminate between low and high responders to resistance exercise (miR-378, -26a, -29a and -451) and correlate to gains in lean body mass (miR-378). The emerging field of exercise epigenomics is expected to prosper and additional studies may elucidate the clinical relevance of miRNAs and epigenetic modifications, and delineate mechanisms by which exercise confers a healthier phenotype and improves performance.},

  abstract = {Hemibody movements are strongly considered as being under the control of the contralateral hemisphere of the cerebral cortex. However, some neuroimaging studies have found a bilateral activation of either the primary sensori-motor (SM1) areas or the rostral prefrontal cortex (PFC), during unimanual tasks. More than just bilateral, the activation of these areas was found to be symmetrical in some studies. However, the symmetrical response remains strongly controversial notably for handgrip force generations. We therefore aimed to examine the bilateral SM1 and rostral PFC area activations in response to graded submaximal force generation during a unilateral handgrip task. Fifteen healthy subjects performed 6 levels of force (ranging from 5 to 50\% of MVC) during a handgrip task. We concomitantly measured the activation of bilateral SM1 and rostral PFC areas through near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the bilateral flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscles. Symmetrical activation was found over the SM1 areas for all the investigated levels of force. At the highest level of force (i.e., 50\% of MVC), the EMG of the passive FDS increased significantly and the ipsilateral rostral PFC activation was found more intense than the corresponding contralateral rostral PFC activation. We suggest that the visuo-guided control of force levels during a handgrip task requires the cross-talk from ipsi- to contralateral SM1 to cope for the relative complexity of the task, similar to that which occurs during complex sequential finger movement. We also propose alternative explanations for the observed symmetrical SM1 activation including (i) the ipsilateral corticospinal tract and (ii) interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) mechanism. The increase in EMG activity over the passive FDS could be associated with a release of IHI at 50\% of MVC. Finally, our results suggest that the greater ipsilateral (right) rostral PFC activation may reflect the greater demand of attention required to control the motor output at high levels of force.},

Nine healthy subjects performed isometric handgrip contractions ranging from 10 to 50\% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) in a 30-s exertion with a 60 s of recovery for three repetitions.

We showed significant positive linear and non-linear relationships between muscle force output and total- and oxy-hemoglobin (R {$>$}0.98, P {$<$} 0.01). Overall, our findings showed that submaximal muscle force and brain activity revealed with NIRS strongly correlate in the motor cortex area, both at group and at subject level from 30\% MVC.

  abstract = {1. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies were performed in six normal right-handed male volunteers (age 30 +/- 3) to investigate the relationship between cerebral activation as measured by relative regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and force peak exerted during right index finger flexion. The purpose was to determine in which central motor structures activity is directly correlated with force for repeatedly executed movements. 2. Twelve PET rCBF measurements were performed in each volunteer with the use of H2(15)O as a perfusion tracer. Volunteers pressed a Morse-key repetitively with their right index finger for 2 min while lying in a supine position in the PET camera. The device was fitted with strain gauges to measure the force peaks exerted upon it. Scans were collected twice each at five different levels of exerted force peak and in a resting state. Individual and group results were co-registered with anatomic magnetic resonance images (MRI). 3. Group analysis revealed four major regions with a high correlation between rCBF and different degrees of repetitively exerted force peaks. One was located in the arm area of the left lateral surface [primary somatosensory and motor cortex (SI, MI)]. The second area was situated on the left mesial surface of the brain, posterior to the anterior commissure (AC) and encompassing the first gyrus dorsal to the cingulate sulcus. This area is thought to be homologous to the posterior part of the supplementary motor area (SMA) in the monkey. The third area was the dorsal bank of the posterior cingulate sulcus. The fourth area showing a significant correlation between rCBF and force peaks was in the cerebellar vermis. 4. Individual PET data were co-registered with each individual's MRI in order to identify precisely the locations of structures demonstrating a positive correlation between rCBF and force peak. Activated areas on the mesial surface consisted of the same two distinct regions seen in the group data. In three subjects the focus on the lateral surface of the cortex appeared to extend into the caudal premotor area; in two it extended into the rostral part of the superior parietal area. In no subject did blood flow inx the anterior cingulate areas and anterior SMA show a correlation with the force exerted. Cerebellar correlations were present in the vermis in all subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the relative size and location of proximal and distal upper limb muscle representations in the human motor cortex. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation were recorded in the proximal muscle anterior deltoid (AD) and in the distal muscles extensor carpi radialis (ECR) and first dorsal interosseus (1DI). The coil was moved in steps of 1 cm along a grid drawn on a tight-fitting polyester cap placed on the subject's head. At each location, four stimuli were delivered at 1.2 times the active motor threshold (AMT), and MEPs averaged in real-time. The peak-to-peak amplitude of each muscle's mean MEP was measured at each stimulation site. The area of a muscle's representation was measured by a pixel-counting algorithm. The optimal point of each muscle's areal representation, which corresponds to the locus near which the largest MEPs are obtained, was determined by fitting a 3D Lorentzian function to the data points. The optimal point of distal muscles tended to be situated more laterally along the motor strip than that of proximal muscles. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the size of the areal representations and they overlapped considerably. Additionally, in another five subjects, using a small 45-mm coil placed in a hyper-focal orientation, maps were obtained at a stimulus intensity of 1.1\textendash 1.15 times the AMT of the muscle with the lowest threshold, usually the 1DI. Even in this very stringent condition, the mapped representations of the AD, ECR and 1DI overlapped, notwithstanding that sharp demarcations between borders were also apparent. These observations demonstrate that stimulus spread alone does not explain the overlap of muscle representations. These results show that commonly used proximal and distal upper-limb muscles, taken individually, are controlled by motor cortical territories of approximately equal size that significantly overlap despite differences in the location of their optimal points.},

It has been successfully applied in the analysis and interpretation of large-scale data arising in neuroscience, computational biology, and natural language processing, among other areas. A distinctive feature of NMF is its nonnegativity constraints that allow only additive linear combinations of the data, thus enabling it to learn parts that have distinct physical representations in reality. In this letter, we describe an information-theoretic approach to NMF for signal-dependent noise based on the generalized inverse gaussian model. Specifically, we propose three novel algorithms in this setting, each based on multiplicative updates, and prove monotonicity of updates using the EM algorithm. In addition, we develop algorithm-specific measures to evaluate their goodness of fit on data. Our methods are demonstrated using experimental data from electromyography studies, as well as simulated data in the extraction of muscle synergies, and compared with existing algorithms for signal-dependent noise.},

METHODS: Seven subjects completed 10 sets of 15 repetitions of right knee-extension exercise lifting 50\% of their one-repetition maximum. Torque (T), knee-joint angle, and the interference EMG of rectus femoris muscle were recorded simultaneously. Maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC) was tested before and after exercise. Median spectral frequency (Fmed) and new spectral indices of muscle fatigue (FInsmk) were calculated for each repetition. RESULTS: The rate and range of FInsmk- and Fmed-relative changes against the first repetition of the corresponding set increased gradually across successive repetitions within the set, reflecting accumulation of peripheral muscle fatigue. The maximal change of FInsmk observed in the present experiment was approximately eightfold, whereas that of Fmed was only 32\%. Significant between-subject variability in the range of FInsmk changes (P {$<$} 0.0001) was found, so a hierarchical cluster analysis of muscle fatigue indices was conducted. Three distinct subgroups of subjects were identified: high (N = 1, FInsmk change {$>$} 400\%), medium (N = 4, 200\% {$<$} FInsmk change {$<$} 400\%), and low (N = 2, FInsmk change {$<$} 200\%) muscle fatigability. The changes in muscle performance during (last vs first repetition peak T, P = 0.03) and after (post- vs preexercise MVC, P = 0.012) exercise were significantly different between clusters (one-way ANOVA). The rate of fatigue development was also significantly different between clusters (linear regression analysis of Fmed and FInsmk changes). CONCLUSIONS: The new spectral indices are a valid and reliable tool for assessment of muscle fatigability irrespective of EMG signal variability caused by dynamic muscle contractions, and these indices are more sensitive than those traditionally used.},

  abstract = {The assessment of muscle-recruitment timing from surface EMG signal (sEMG) is relevant in different fields, including clinical gait analysis and robotic systems to interpret user's motion intention. However, available methods typically provide only information in time domain without evaluating muscle-activation frequency content. This study aims to propose a novel adaptative algorithm for detecting muscle activation in time-frequency domain based on continuous wavelet transform (CWT) analysis. Precisely, the novel contribution of the proposed algorithm consists of evaluating the frequency range of every muscle activations detected in time domain. Performances are evaluated on a test bench of 720 simulated sEMG signals and 105 real sEMG signals, stratified for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and then validated against different reference algorithms. Outcomes indicate that the proposed approach can provide an accurate prediction of muscle onset and offset timing in both simulated (mean absolute error, MAE {$\approx$} 10 ms) and real datasets (MAE {$<$} 30 ms), minimally affected by the SNR variability and compatible with the timing of sEMG-driven assistive devices. Concomitantly, the maximum frequency of the activations is computed, ranging from around 100 Hz up to almost 500 Hz. This suggest a large within-muscle between-muscle variability of the frequency range. In conclusion, the current study introduces a novel reliable wavelet-based algorithm to detect both time and frequency content of muscle activation, suitable in different conditions of signal quality.},

The surface electromyographic signal (sEMG) reflects the degree of activation of skeletal muscles and certain that the sEMG is highly correlated to the muscle force. However, the largest disadvantage in predicting the muscle force from sEMG is the fact that the force generated by a muscle cannot be directly measured non-invasively. Indirect measurement of muscle force goes along with other unpredictable factors which influence the detected force but not necessarily the sEMG data. In addition, the sEMG is often difficult to interpret correctly. The sEMG-force relationship has been investigated for a long time and numerous papers are available. This review shows the limitations in predicting the muscle force from sEMG signals and gives some perspectives on how these limitations could be overcome, especially in clinical applications, by using novel ways of interpretation.},

Subjects were asked to perform six different tasks involving the left ankle joint. The tasks consisted of voluntary isometric plantar flexions at three different RTDs (two fixed rates and a `ballistic' task) ending at two different torque amplitudes. The main observations from the analysis of the MRPs were: 1) the readiness potentials (RP) demonstrated a statistically significant discrimination between low and high torque amplitudes; 2) the RP, the motor potentials (MP) and the movement-monitoring potentials (MMP) could be statistically differentiated among the different RTDs; and 3) in general the MRPs demonstrated an ipsilateral tendency in relation to the involved limb. The results indicate that RP is a suitable parameter for differentiation between levels of isometric plantar flexion torque and MP and MMP are sensitive to a differentiation between RTDs. The correlation between MRPs and motor tasks involving different rates of torque development and levels of torque suggests that MRPs may comprise a potential solution for programming of intended movements to be executed by systems based on neural rehabilitation technology.},

  abstract = {Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been used to measure concentration changes of cerebral hemoglobin and cytochrome in neonates, children, and adults, to study cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics. To derive quantitative concentration changes from measurements of light attenuation, the optical path length must be known. This is obtained by multiplying the source/detector separation by a laboratory measured differential path length factor (DPF) which accounts for the increased distance traveled by light due to scattering. DPF has been measured by time of flight techniques on small populations of adults and postmortem infants. The values for adults are greater than those for newborns, and it is not clear how to interpolate the present data for studies on children. Recent developments in instrumentation using phase resolved spectroscopy techniques have produced a bedside unit which can measure optical path length on any subject. We have developed an intensity modulated optical spectrometer which measures path length at four wavelengths. Two hundred and eighty three subjects from 1 d of age to 50 y were studied. Measurements were made at a fixed frequency of 200 MHz and a source detector separation of 4.5 cm. Results suggest a slowly varying age dependence of DPF, following the relation DPF690 = 5.38 + 0.049A0.877, DPF744 = 5.11 + 0.106A0.723, DPF807 = 4.99 + 0.067A0.814, and DPF832 = 4.67 + 0.062A0.819, where DPF690 is the DPF measured at 690 nm and A is age is expressed in years from full term. There was a wide scatter of values, however, implying that ideally DPF should be measured at the time of each study.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: While a clearer image of the physiological process of recovery from physical exertion is emerging, research into the recovery of the central nervous system is still in its infancy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the nature of motor cortical activity and peak force production 24 hours after resistance exercise. METHODS: Four resistance training protocols were chosen based on their differential interaction with force production: high power (6 x 3 squat jumps at 30\% of 1RM); high force (6 x 3 squat at 95\% of 1RM); high volume (6 x 10 at 80\% of their 1RM); and a control day (6 sets of unracking an empty bar). Twenty-four hours after the intervention, subjects returned to perform a peak isometric squat along with corresponding EEG, perceptual, and blood measures. To control for the rate of adaptation, only highly trained male subjects (years of training: 6+/-1 yrs; squat 1RM: 174+/-26 kg; age: 22+/-3 yrs; body mass: 84.76+/-9.86 kg; n = 7) were included in this study. Cortical activity was measured using an Ag-AgCl electrode-cap, a 40-channel monopolar digital amplifier, and an expanded International 10\textendash 20 electrode placement. Linked-ears reference, a ground scalp electrode, and eye electrodes were used to account for electrical artifacts (facial contractions). Movement artifacts were removed using a spatial filter. A 32-bit analog-to-digital converter was used to digitize signals at a sampling rate of 1000hz. High and low frequency bandpass was set at DC and 100hz respectively and signals were low-pass filtered at 50hz using an Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) recursive filter set to a roll-off of 12dB/oct. Impedance was maintained at or below 5 Kohms throughout the experimental protocol. Channels possessing gross artifacts were eliminated. DC drift was removed using a 3rd order polynomial trend correction for each channel. Epochs were set from the completion of the previous movement or the movement of the bar off the rack to the completion of the next repetition. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were determined for selected pair wise variables. One-way and univariate analyses of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures and Fisher's LSD post-hocs were used to detect significant mean differences. Significance level in this study was set at a 0.05 alpha level. RESULTS: Peak isometric squat force was equated by 24 hours post-exercise. The grand average movement related cortical potential area under the curve and mean global field power amplitude were also equated between recovery protocols. Despite the differences between each protocol, we were unable to detect statistically significant differences (in either mean amplitude or area under the curve) for global field power during isometric squats at an alpha level of 0.05. Therefore, the primary finding of this investigation was that 24 hours after differing maximal exertion force production protocols, cortical activity and peak force appear to recover to baseline. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the cortical findings suggest that the central responses of well-trained men recover from differing domains of resistance exercise within twenty-four hours. Practical Applications: It is possible that the central nervous system recovers quickly from resistance exercise in the well-trained population. Other limitations to physiological recovery, such as performance decrement, soreness, or fatigue, may be attributable to peripheral, rather than central, causes. Primary damage, particularly with eccentric movement, cannot be ignored. In addition, our laboratory has shown that exercise-induced hypoxia results in secondary damage to muscle through a series of biochemical reactions. The role of the central nervous system in the control of physiological function cannot be underestimated, and this study should be placed appropriately within the context of this evolving area of research.},

In an fMRI-study, 58 persons with lower (n=28) or respectively higher (n=30) intelligence worked on simple and difficult inductive reasoning tasks having the same person-specific task difficulty. Consequently, less bright individuals received sample-based easy and medium tasks, whereas bright subjects received sample-based medium and difficult tasks. This design also allowed a comparison of lower versus higher intelligent individuals when working on the same tasks (i.e. sample-based medium task difficulty). In line with expectations, differences in task performance and in brain activation were only found for the subset of tasks with the same sample-based task difficulty, but not when comparing tasks with the same person-specific task difficulty. These results suggest that neural efficiency reflects an (ability-dependent) adaption of brain activation to the respective task demands.},

Purpose~         Repetitive resistance exercise with large muscle mass causes rapid fluctuations in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). We sought to determine the effect of these fluctuations on the cerebrovasculature response determined by mean flow velocity (Vmean) of the middle cerebral artery.         Methods~         Nine subjects performed 10-repetition maximum leg press exercise. MAP was estimated by finger photoplethysmography, Vmean by Doppler ultrasound, and end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2) by mass spectrometry.         Results~         Vmean fluctuated with MAP with each repetition however averaged over the 10 repetitions, Vmean was unchanged from resting baseline values (66.9 {$\pm$} 10.8 vs 67.7 {$\pm$} 12.3 cm{$\cdot$}s-1, baseline vs exercise, P {$>$} 0.05) despite an increased MAP (89.5 {$\pm$} 8.4 vs 105.0 {$\pm$} 4.9 Torr, P {$<$} 0.05). PETCO2 also remained unchanged from rest to exercise (37.7 {$\pm$} 2.8 vs 36.6 {$\pm$} 2.7 Torr, P {$>$} 0.05). Vmean decreased below resting levels for the first 5 s of recovery (59.8 {$\pm$} 9.1 cm{$\cdot$}s-1, P {$<$} 0.05) as MAP returned rapidly to slightly below baseline (83.3 {$\pm$} 6.1, P {$>$} 0.05). MAP/Vmean, an index of cerebrovascular resistance, was elevated during exercise and returned to baseline after exercise. An increase in Vmean at 30 s post exercise (78.4 {$\pm$} 10.6 cm{$\cdot$}s-1, P {$<$} 0.05) corresponded with elevated PETCO2 (43.0 {$\pm$} 4.8 Torr, P {$>$} 0.05).         Conclusion~         The results suggest that fluctuations in MAP with individual muscle contractions during resistance exercise appear to be too rapid to be countered by cerebrovascular autoregulation. However, the progressive increase in MAP over a number of contractions was effectively countered to maintain Vmean near baseline values before a decrease in Vmean immediately after exercise.},

We here present a new approach to make use of three-dimensional probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps, as obtained from the analysis of human post-mortem brains, for correlating microscopical, anatomical and functional imaging data of the cerebral cortex. We introduce a new, MATLAB based toolbox for the SPM2 software package which enables the integration of probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps and results of functional imaging studies. The toolbox includes the functionality for the construction of summary maps combining probability of several cortical areas by finding the most probable assignment of each voxel to one of these areas. Its main feature is to provide several measures defining the degree of correspondence between architectonic areas and functional foci. The software, together with the presently available probability maps, is available as open source software to the neuroimaging community. This new toolbox provides an easy-to-use tool for the integrated analysis of functional and anatomical data in a common reference space.},

This study evaluated the alteration of corticomuscular communication and motor control through the quantification of corticomuscular coherence (CMC) and absolute (AE) and variable error (VE) of the force production throughout a 3 week Maximal Strength Training (MST) intervention specifically designed to strengthen ankle plantarflexion (PF). Evaluation sessions with electroencephalography, electromyography, and torque recordings were conducted pre-training, 1 week after the training initiation, then post-training. Training effect was evaluated over the maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC), the submaximal torque production, AE and VE, muscle activation, and CMC changes during submaximal contractions at 20\% of the initial and daily MVIC. MVIC increased significantly throughout the training completion. For submaximal contractions, agonist muscle activation decreased over time only for the initial torque level while antagonist muscle activation, AE, and VE decreased over time for each torque level. CMC remained unaltered by the MST. Our results revealed that neurophysiological adaptations are noticeable as soon as 1 week post-training. However, CMC remained unaltered by MST, suggesting that central motor adaptations may take longer to be translated into CMC alteration.},

  abstract = {Electronic medical record (EMR) is currently a popular topic in e-health. EMR includes the health-related information of patients and forms the main factor of e-health applications. Moreover, EMR contains the legal records that are created in the medical centre and ambulatory environments. These records serve as the data source for electronic health record. Although hospitals utilise the EMR system, healthcare professionals experience difficultly in trusting this system. Studies devoted to EMR acceptance in hospitals are lacking, particularly those on the EMR system in the contexts of privacy and security concerns based on multi-criteria perspective. Thus, the current study proposes a decision support examination framework on how individual, security and privacy determinants influence the acceptance and use of EMR. The proposed framework is based on a multi-criteria perspective derived from healthcare professionals in Malaysia as frame of reference. The framework comprises four phases. The sub-factors of individual, security and privacy determinants were investigated in the two initial phases. Thereafter, the sub-factors were identified with uniform multi-criteria perspective to establish a decision matrix. The decision matrix used individual uniform as basis to cluster the sub-factors and user perspectives. Subsequently, a new `multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach' was adopted. Integrated technique for order of preference by similarity (TOPSIS) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) were used as bases in employing the MCDM approach to rank each group of factors. K-means clustering was also applied to identify the critical factors in each group. Healthcare professionals in Malaysia were selected as respondents and 100 questionnaires were distributed to those employed in 5 Malaysian public hospitals. A conceptual model adapted from Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) was employed to clarify the connection between individual, privacy and security determinants and EMR system acceptance and use in the selected context. After collecting the data sets (363), structural equation modelling was used to analyse data related to EMR acceptance and use. Results are as follows. (1) Five determinants (i.e. data integrity, confidentiality, non-repudiation, facilitating conditions and effort expectancy) exerted an explicit and important positive effect on EMR acceptance and use. (2) Three determinants (i.e. unauthorised, error and secondary use) exerted a direct and significant negative effect on EMR acceptance and use. (3) Three other determinants (i.e. authentication, performance expectancy and habit) insignificantly affected the behavioural intention of healthcare experts in Malaysia to use EMR.},

EEG was recorded using a 64-channel system at 500 Hz. Independent component (IC) analysis parsed the EEG scalp data into maximal ICs. An equivalent current dipole model was calculated for each IC, and results were clustered across subjects. A time-frequency analysis of the identified electrocortical clusters was performed to investigate the magnitude and timing of event-related spectral perturbations. Significant changes (P {$<$} 0.05) in electrocortical activity were found in frontal, supplementary motor and parietal areas of the cortex. Overall, there was a significant increase in EEG power as fatigue developed throughout the exercise. The strongest increase was found in the frontal area of the cortex. The timing of event-related desynchronization within the supplementary motor area corresponds with the onset of force production and the transition from flexion to extension in the pedaling cycle. The results indicate an involvement of the cerebral cortex during the pedaling task that most likely involves executive control function, as well as motor planning and execution.},

It is known that fatigue can be caused by many different mechanisms, ranging from the accumulation of metabolites within muscle fibres to the generation of an inadequate motor command in the motor cortex, and that there is no global mechanism responsible for muscle fatigue. Rather, the mechanisms that cause fatigue are specific to the task being performed. The development of muscle fatigue is typically quantified as a decline in the maximal force or power capacity of muscle, which means that submaximal contractions can be sustained after the onset of muscle fatigue. There is even evidence that the duration of some sustained tasks is not limited by fatigue of the principal muscles. Here we review experimental approaches that focus on identifying the mechanisms that limit task failure rather than those that cause muscle fatigue. Selected comparisons of tasks, groups of individuals and interventions with the task-failure approach can provide insight into the rate-limiting adjustments that constrain muscle function during fatiguing contractions.},

  abstract = {Despite flourishing interest in the topic of fatigue\textemdash as indicated by the many presentations on fatigue at the 2015 Annual Meeting of the American College of Sports Medicine\textemdash surprisingly little is known about its effect on human performance. There are two main reasons for this dilemma: 1) the inability of current terminology to accommodate the scope of the conditions ascribed to fatigue, and 2) a paucity of validated experimental models. In contrast to current practice, a case is made for a unified definition of fatigue to facilitate its management in health and disease. On the basis of the classic two-domain concept of Mosso, fatigue is defined as a disabling symptom in which physical and cognitive function is limited by interactions between performance fatigability and perceived fatigability. As a symptom, fatigue can only be measured by self-report, quantified as either a trait characteristic or a state variable. One consequence of such a definition is that the word fatigue should not be preceded by an adjective (e.g., central, mental, muscle, peripheral, and supraspinal) to suggest the locus of the changes responsible for an observed level of fatigue. Rather, mechanistic studies should be performed with validated experimental models to identify the changes responsible for the reported fatigue. As indicated by three examples (walking endurance in old adults, time trials by endurance athletes, and fatigue in persons with multiple sclerosis) discussed in the review, however, it has proven challenging to develop valid experimental models of fatigue. The proposed framework provides a foundation to address the many gaps in knowledge of how laboratory measures of fatigue and fatigability affect real-world performance.},

The mechanisms that can produce fatigue involve all elements of the motor system, from a failure of the formulation of the descending drive provided by suprasegmental centers to a reduction in the activity of the contractile proteins. We propose four themes that provide a basis for the systematic evaluation of the neural and neuromuscular fatigue mechanisms: 1) task dependency to identify the conditions that activate the various mechanisms; 2) force-fatigability relationship to explore the interaction between the mechanisms that results in a hyperbolic relationship between force and endurance time; 3) muscle wisdom to examine the association among a concurrent decline in force, relaxation rate, and motor neuron discharge that results in an optimization of force; and 4) sense of effort to determine the role of effort in the impairment of performance. On the basis of this perspective with an emphasis on neural mechanisms, we suggest a number of experiments to advance our understanding of the neurobiology of muscle fatigue.},

  abstract = {Early effects of a resistance training program include neural adaptations at multiple levels of the neuraxis, but direct evidence of central changes is lacking. Plasticity exhibited by multiple supraspinal centers following training may alter slow negative electroencephalographic activity, referred to as movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP). The purpose of this study was to determine whether MRCPs are altered in response to resistance training. Eleven healthy participants (24.6~{$\pm~$}3.5~years) performed 3~weeks of explosive unilateral leg extensor resistance training. MRCP were assessed during 60 self-paced leg extensions against a constant nominal load before and after training. Resistance training was effective (P~{$<~$}0.001) in increasing leg extensor peak force (+22\%), rate of force production (+32\%) as well as muscle activity (iEMG; +47\%, P~{$<~$}0.05). These changes were accompanied by several MRCP effects. Following training, MRCP amplitude was attenuated at several scalp sites overlying motor-related cortical areas (P~{$<~$}0.05), and the onset of MRCP at the vertex was 28\% (561~ms) earlier. In conclusion, the 3-week training protocol in the present study elicited significant strength gains which were accompanied by neural adaptations at the level of the cortex. We interpret our findings of attenuated cortical demand for submaximal voluntary movement as evidence for enhanced neural economy as a result of resistance training.},

Eight healthy subjects performed 50 voluntary eccentric and 50 voluntary concentric elbow flexor contractions against a load equal to 10\% body weight. Surface EEG signals from four scalp locations overlying sensorimotor-related cortical areas in the frontal and parietal lobes were measured along with kinetic and kinematic information from the muscle and joint. MRCP was derived from the EEG signals of the eccentric and concentric muscle contractions. Although the elbow flexor muscle activation (EMG) was lower during eccentric than concentric actions, the amplitude of two major MRCP components\textemdash one related to movement planning and execution and the other associated with feedback signals from the peripheral systems\textemdash was significantly greater for eccentric than for concentric actions. The MRCP onset time for the eccentric task occurred earlier than that for the concentric task. The greater cortical signal for eccentric muscle actions suggests that the brain probably plans and programs eccentric movements differently from concentric muscle tasks.},

  abstract = {Eccentric muscle contractions generate greater force at a lower level of activation and subject muscles to more severe damage than do concentric actions. A recent investigation has revealed that electroencephalogram (EEG)-derived movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) is greater and occurs earlier for controlling human eccentric than concentric submaximal muscle contractions. However, whether the central nervous system (CNS) control signals for high-intensity or maximal-effort eccentric movements differ from those for concentric actions is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the MRCP signals differ between the two types of maximal-effort contractions. Eight volunteers performed 40 maximal voluntary eccentric and 40 maximal voluntary concentric elbow flexor contractions on a Kin-Com isokinetic dynamometer. Scalp EEG signals (62 channels) were measured along with force, joint angle, and electromyographic (EMG) signals of the performing muscles. MRCP-based two-dimensional brain maps were created to illustrate spatial and temporal distributions of the MRCP signals. Although the level of elbow flexor muscle activity was lower during eccentric than concentric movements, MRCP-indicated cortical activation was greater both in amplitude and area dimension for the eccentric task. Detailed comparisons of individual electrode signals suggested that eccentric movements needed a significantly longer time for early preparation and a significantly greater magnitude of cortical activity for later movement execution. The extra preparation time and higher amplitude of activation may reflect CNS activities that account for the higher risk of injury, higher degree of movement difficulty, and unique motor unit activation pattern associated with maximal-level eccentric muscle actions.},

Among the many uses of the surface EMG in studying the neural control of movement, the review critically evaluates only some of the applications. The focus is on the relations between global features of the surface EMG and the underlying physiological processes. Because direct measurements of motor unit activation are not available and many factors can influence the signal, these relations are frequently misinterpreted. These errors are compounded by the counterintuitive effects that some system parameters can have on the EMG signal. The phenomenon of crosstalk is used as an example of these problems. The review describes the limitations of techniques used to infer the level of muscle activation, the type of motor unit recruited, the upper limit of motor unit recruitment, the average discharge rate, and the degree of synchronization between motor units. Although the global surface EMG is a useful measure of muscle activation and assessment, there are limits to the information that can be extracted from this signal.},

  abstract = {A surface EMG signal represents the linear transformation of motor neuron discharge times by the compound action potentials of the innervated muscle fibers and is often used as a source of information about neural activation of muscle. However, retrieving the embedded neural code from a surface EMG signal is extremely challenging. Most studies use indirect approaches in which selected features of the signal are interpreted as indicating certain characteristics of the neural code. These indirect associations are constrained by limitations that have been detailed previously (Farina D, Merletti R, Enoka RM. J Appl Physiol 96: 1486\textendash 1495, 2004) and are generally difficult to overcome. In an update on these issues, the current review extends the discussion to EMG-based coherence methods for assessing neural connectivity. We focus first on EMG amplitude cancellation, which intrinsically limits the association between EMG amplitude and the intensity of the neural activation and then discuss the limitations of coherence methods (EEG-EMG, EMG-EMG) as a way to assess the strength of the transmission of synaptic inputs into trains of motor unit action potentials. The debated influence of rectification on EMG spectral analysis and coherence measures is also discussed. Alternatively, there have been a number of attempts to identify the neural information directly by decomposing surface EMG signals into the discharge times of motor unit action potentials. The application of this approach is extremely powerful, but validation remains a central issue.},

  abstract = {The power-duration relationship is well documented for athletic performance and is formulated out mathematically in the critical power (CP) model. The CP model, when applied properly, has great predictive power, e.g. pedaling at a specific power output on an ergometer the model precisely calculates the time over which an athlete can sustain this power. However, CP presents physiological inconsistencies and process-oriented problems. The rapid development of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure muscle oxygenation (SmO2) dynamics provides a physiological exploration of the CP model on a conceptual and empirical level. Conceptually, the CP model provides two components: first CP is defined as the highest metabolic rate that can be achieved through oxidative means. And second, work capacity above CP named W'. SmO2 presents a steady-state in oxygen supply and demand and thereby represents CP specifically at a local level of analysis. Empirically, exploratory data quickly illustrates the relationship between performance and SmO2, as shown during 3-min all-out cycling tests to assess CP. During these tests, performance and SmO2 essentially mirror each other, and both CP and W' generate solid correlation with what would be deemed their SmO2 counterparts: first, the steady-state of SmO2 correlates with CP. And second, the tissue oxygen reserve represented in SmO2, when calculated as an integral corresponds to W'. While the empirical data presented is preliminary, the proposition of a concurring physiological model to the current CP model is a plausible inference. Here we propose that SmO2 steady-state representing CP as critical oxygenation or CO. And the tissue oxygen reserve above CO would then be identified as O'. This new CO model could fill in the physiological gap between the highly predictive CP model and at times its inability to track human physiology consistently. For simplicity's sake, this would include acute changes in physiology as a result of changing climate or elevation with travel, which can affect performance. These types of acute fluctuations, but not limited to, would be manageable when applying a CO model in conjunction with the CP model. Further, modeling is needed to investigate the true potential of NIRS to model CP, with a focus on repeatability, recovery, and systemic vs local workloads.},

To further investigate this we compared the electromyographic (EMG) response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during voluntary contractions of ten subjects who have been training for more than 2~years, resistance-training (RT) group, and ten subjects that have never participated in resistance training (NT). The active motor threshold for biceps brachii was obtained during voluntary elbow flexion at 10\% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). TMS was also delivered at 100\% of the maximal stimulator output while the participants exerted forces ranging from 10 to 90\% of MVC. Evoked force, motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and latency from biceps brachii was recorded for each condition to explore changes in corticospinal excitability. The evoked force was significantly lower in the RT group in comparison with the NT group between 30 and 70\% of MVC intensity (P{$<$}0.05). At 90\% of MVC, nine subjects from the RT group showed an absence in the evoked force while this occurred in only five subjects from the NT group. The MEP amplitude and latency changed significantly (P{$<$}0.001) with increasing levels of contraction, without significant difference between groups. These results indicate that changes in the CNS are sustained in the log-term practices of resistance training and permit a higher voluntary activation at several intensities of the MVC.},

The main NIRS instrumentations and measurable parameters will be reported. NIR light (700-1000\hspace{0.6em}nm) penetrates superficial layers (skin, subcutaneous fat, skull, etc.) and is either absorbed by chromophores (oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin and myoglobin) or scattered within the tissue. NIRS is a noninvasive and relatively low-cost optical technique that is becoming a widely used instrument for measuring tissue O2 saturation, changes in hemoglobin volume and, indirectly, brain/muscle blood flow and muscle O2 consumption. Tissue O2 saturation represents a dynamic balance between O2 supply and O2 consumption in the small vessels such as the capillary, arteriolar, and venular bed. The possibility of measuring the cortical activation in response to different stimuli, and the changes in the cortical cytochrome oxidase redox state upon O2 delivery changes, will also be mentioned.

  abstract = {Background: Although the median frequency is used as a basis to assess the presence of muscular fatigue, some studies have found that it is not a good estimator for this purpose. Physiotherapists often deal with patients with movement issues related to fatigue. A new objective estimator that is easy to obtain and interpret can help with the management of such patients.Objective and Purpose: The aim of this study was to identify the frequency bands most affected by fatigue and propose a protocol to obtain such information.Methods: Thirty healthy subjects (age 22.05 {$\pm$} 2.42 years, height 1.71 {$\pm$} 0.08 m, and weight 68.75 {$\pm$} 11.42 kg) were recruited to measure the rectus femoris electromyography (EMG) of both legs during gait, before and after a fatiguing protocol. Four frequency bands were studied: high frequency (107\textendash 250 Hz), midfrequency (65\textendash 94 Hz), 40 Hz (34\textendash 53 Hz), and low frequency ({$<$} 25 Hz). Each frequency band is related to different aspects of the muscular contraction.Results: The main finding is that the ratios of the 40-Hz frequency and low-frequency bands showed significant differences in both legs between pre-fatigue and post-fatigue recordings. Critical thresholds F* 4.86 and 4.93 were exceeded at 4.5\textendash 8.7\%, 30.64\textendash 46\%.38, 63.75\textendash 66.8\%, and 83.69\textendash 90.79\% and at 0\textendash 2.53\%, 4.7\textendash 15.21\%, 18.15\textendash 54.65\%, and 55.81\textendash 99.95\% of the gait cycle, respectively, with p values {$<$} .05.Conclusions: The low-frequency band constitutes the best indicator to assess fatigue in gait.},

The purpose of this within-group quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) investigation was to examine changes in cortical activity amplitude and location during four resistance exercise movement protocols emphasizing rate (PWR), magnitude (FOR), or volume (VOL) of force production, while accounting for movement familiarity and fatigue. EEG signals were recorded during each complete repetition and were then grouped by functional region, processed to eliminate artifacts, and averaged to compare overall differences in the magnitude and location of cortical activity between protocols over the course of six sets. Biomechanical, biochemical, and exertional data were collected to contextualize electrophysiological data. The most fatiguing protocols were accompanied by the greatest increases in cortical activity. Furthermore, despite non-incremental loading and lower force levels, VOL displayed the largest increases in cortical activity over time and greatest motor and sensory activity overall. Our findings suggest that cortical activity is strongly related to aspects of fatigue during a high intensity resistance exercise movement.},

  abstract = {Cortical activity is thought to reflect the biomechanical properties of movement (e.g., force or velocity of movement), but fatigue and movement familiarity are important factors that require additional consideration in electrophysiological research. The purpose of this within-group quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) investigation was to examine changes in cortical activity amplitude and location during four resistance exercise movement protocols emphasizing rate (PWR), magnitude (FOR), or volume (VOL) of force production, while accounting for movement familiarity and fatigue. EEG signals were recorded during each complete repetition and were then grouped by functional region, processed to eliminate artifacts, and averaged to compare overall differences in the magnitude and location of cortical activity between protocols over the course of six sets. Biomechanical, biochemical, and exertional data were collected to contextualize electrophysiological data. The most fatiguing protocols were accompanied by the greatest increases in cortical activity. Furthermore, despite non-incremental loading and lower force levels, VOL displayed the largest increases in cortical activity over time and greatest motor and sensory activity overall. Our findings suggest that cortical activity is strongly related to aspects of fatigue during a high intensity resistance exercise movement.},

  abstract = {Strength training is a critical exercise stimulus for inducing changes in muscular strength, size and power (6). Recently, linear position transducers have gained in popularity as a means to monitor velocity in strength training exercises. The measurement error of such devices has been shown to be low and both relative and absolute reliability have been shown to be acceptable (2, 7, 11). The purpose of this article is to provide the overview and benefits of monitoring movement velocity in strength training exercises, along with providing the basis for novel ``velocity-based'' strength training prescription. We have covered the following practical applications: Guidelines to develop a velocity/load profile for athletes; Using the velocity load/profile to predict and monitor changes to maximal strength; Using velocity monitoring to control fatigue effects of strength training; Using velocity monitoring as an immediate performance feedback to promote the highest level of effort in specific training exercises and stronger adaptive stimuli. Linear position transducers are reliable and valid tools to help strength and conditioning practitioners monitor and optimize their strength training programs.},

  abstract = {Background One of the mechanisms responsible for enhancing muscular hypertrophy is the high metabolic stress associated with a reduced muscular oxygenation occurring during exercise, which can be achieved by reducing the speed of movement. Studies have tested that lowered muscle oxygenation artificially induced by an inflatable cuff, could provoke changes in prefrontal cortex oxygenation, hence, to central fatigue. It was hypothesized that (1) exercising with a slow speed of movement would result in greater increase in cerebral and greater decrease in muscle oxygenation compared with exercises of faster speed and (2) the amount of oxygenation increase in the ipsilateral prefrontal cortex would be lower than the contralateral one. Methods An ISS Imagent frequency domain near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system was used to quantify oxygenation changes in the vastus lateralis muscle and prefrontal cortex (contra- and ipsilateral) during unilateral resistance exercises with different speeds of movement to voluntary fatigue. After one maximal repetition (1RM) test, eight subjects performed three sets of unilateral knee extensions ({$\sim$}50\% of 1RM), separated by 2 min rest periods, following the pace of 1 s, 3 s and 5 s for both concentric and eccentric phases, in a random order, during separate sessions. The amount of change for NIRS parameters for muscle ({$\Delta$}Hb: deoxyhemoglobin, {$\Delta$}HbO: oxyhemoglobin, {$\Delta$}HbT: total hemoglobin, {$\Delta$}StO2: oxygen saturation) were quantified and compared between conditions and sets by two-way ANOVA RM. Differences in NIRS parameters between contra- and ipsilateral (lobe) prefrontal cortex and conditions were tested. Results Exercising with slow speed of movement was associated to larger muscle deoxygenation than normal speed of movement, as revealed by significant interaction (set \texttimes{} condition) for {$\Delta$}Hb (p~=~0.01), and by significant main effects of condition for {$\Delta$}HbO (p~=~0.007) and {$\Delta$}StO2 (p~=~0.016). With regards to the prefrontal cortex, contralateral lobe showed larger oxygenation increase than the ipsilateral one for {$\Delta$}Hb, {$\Delta$}HbO, {$\Delta$}HbT, {$\Delta$}StO2 in each set (main effect of lobe: p~{$<~$}0.05). Main effects of condition were significant only in set1 for all the parameters, and significant interaction lobe \texttimes{} condition was found only for {$\Delta$}Hb in set1 (p~{$<~$}0.05). Discussion These findings provided evidence that speed of movement influences the amount of muscle oxygenation. Since the lack of oxygen in muscle is associated to increased metabolic stress, manipulating the speed of movement may be useful in planning resistance-training programs. Moreover, consistent oxygenation increases in both right and left prefrontal lobes were found, suggesting a complementary interaction between the ipsi- and contralateral prefrontal cortex, which also seems related to fatigue.},

  abstract = {Encoding muscular force output during voluntary contractions is widely perceived to result, at least in part, from modulations in neuronal activity within the sensorimotor cortex. However the underlying electrophysiological phenomena associated with increased force output remains unclear. This study directly assessed sensorimotor cortex activity using electroencephalography (EEG) in humans performing isometric knee-extensions at a range of discrete torque levels. Fifteen healthy males (age 24 (s=5) years) completed one familiarization and one experimental trial. Participants performed a cyclic series of 60 isometric knee-extension contractions with the right leg, including 15 contractions of a 5-s duration at each of four discrete torque levels: 15\%, 30\%, 45\% and 60\% of maximal voluntary torque (MVT). Isometric knee-extension torque, quadriceps electromyography and EEG were recorded at rest and throughout all the contractions. EEG (0.5-50 Hz) was collected using a 32-channel active-electrode cap. A voxel-based low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) analysis calculated cortical activation within the sensorimotor cortex (one of 27 MNI coordinates) for the entire 0.5-50-Hz range (cortical current density (CCD)), as well as for each constituent frequency band in this range (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma). Gamma band (30-50 Hz) cortical activity increased with contraction torque (analysis of variance [ANOVA], P=0.03). Conversely, activity within the other frequency bands was not modulated by torque (P{$\geq$}0.09), nor was overall CCD (P=0.11). Peripheral neuromuscular activation (quadriceps electromyography (EMG) amplitude) demonstrated distinct increases between each torque level (P{$<$}0.01). In conclusion, sensorimotor cortical activity within the gamma band demonstrated an overall increase with contraction torque, whereas both CCD and each of the other constituent frequency bands were not modulated by increments in torque magnitude during isometric knee-extension contractions up to 60\%MVT.},

  abstract = {It is generally accepted that neural factors play an important role in muscle strength gains. This article reviews the neural adaptations in strength, with the goal of laying the foundations for practical applications in sports medicine and rehabilitation. An increase in muscular strength without noticeable hypertrophy is the first line of evidence for neural involvement in acquisition of muscular strength. The use of surface electromyographic (SEMG) techniques reveal that strength gains in the early phase of a training regimen are associated with an increase in the amplitude of SEMG activity. This has been interpreted as an increase in neural drive, which denotes the magnitude of efferent neural output from the CNS to active muscle fibres. However, SEMG activity is a global measure of muscle activity. Underlying alterations in SEMG activity are changes in motor unit firing patterns as measured by indwelling (wire or needle) electrodes. Some studies have reported a transient increase in motor unit firing rate. Training-related increases in the rate of tension development have also been linked with an increased probability of doublet firing in individual motor units. A doublet is a very short interspike interval in a motor unit train, and usually occurs at the onset of a muscular contraction. Motor unit synchronisation is another possible mechanism for increases in muscle strength, but has yet to be definitely demonstrated. There are several lines of evidence for central control of training-related adaptation to resistive exercise. Mental practice using imagined contractions has been shown to increase the excitability of the cortical areas involved in movement and motion planning. However, training using imagined contractions is unlikely to be as effective as physical training, and it may be more applicable to rehabilitation. Retention of strength gains after dissipation of physiological effects demonstrates a strong practice effect. Bilateral contractions are associated with lower SEMG and strength compared with unilateral contractions of the same muscle group. SEMG magnitude is lower for eccentric contractions than for concentric contractions. However, resistive training can reverse these trends. The last line of evidence presented involves the notion that unilateral resistive exercise of a specific limb will also result in training effects in the unexercised contralateral limb (cross-transfer or cross-education). Peripheral involvement in training-related strength increases is much more uncertain. Changes in the sensory receptors (i.e. Golgi tendon organs) may lead to disinhibition and an increased expression of muscular force. Agonist muscle activity results in limb movement in the desired direction, while antagonist activity opposes that motion. Both decreases and increases in co-activation of the antagonist have been demonstrated. A reduction in antagonist co-activation would allow increased expression of agonist muscle force, while an increase in antagonist co-activation is important for maintaining the integrity of the joint. Thus far, it is not clear what the CNS will optimise: force production or joint integrity. The following recommendations are made by the authors based on the existing literature. Motor learning theory and imagined contractions should be incorporated into strength-training practice. Static contractions at greater muscle lengths will transfer across more joint angles. Submaximal eccentric contractions should be used when there are issues of muscle pain, detraining or limb immobilisation. The reversal of antagonists (antagonist-to-agonist) proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation contraction pattern would be useful to increase the rate of tension development in older adults, thus serving as an important prophylactic in preventing falls. When evaluating the neural changes induced by strength training using EMG recording, antagonist EMG activity should always be measured and evaluated.},

  abstract = {Muscle fatigue is an exercise-induced reduction in maximal voluntary muscle force. It may arise not only because of peripheral changes at the level of the muscle, but also because the central nervous system fails to drive the motoneurons adequately. Evidence for ``central'' fatigue and the neural mechanisms underlying it are reviewed, together with its terminology and the methods used to reveal it. Much data suggest that voluntary activation of human motoneurons and muscle fibers is suboptimal and thus maximal voluntary force is commonly less than true maximal force. Hence, maximal voluntary strength can often be below true maximal muscle force. The technique of twitch interpolation has helped to reveal the changes in drive to motoneurons during fatigue. Voluntary activation usually diminishes during maximal voluntary isometric tasks, that is central fatigue develops, and motor unit firing rates decline. Transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex during fatiguing exercise has revealed focal changes in cortical excitability and inhibitability based on electromyographic (EMG) recordings, and a decline in supraspinal ``drive'' based on force recordings. Some of the changes in motor cortical behavior can be dissociated from the development of this ``supraspinal'' fatigue. Central changes also occur at a spinal level due to the altered input from muscle spindle, tendon organ, and group III and IV muscle afferents innervating the fatiguing muscle. Some intrinsic adaptive properties of the motoneurons help to minimize fatigue. A number of other central changes occur during fatigue and affect, for example, proprioception, tremor, and postural control. Human muscle fatigue does not simply reside in the muscle.},

To understand the multiscale dynamics of neuromuscular activity, we investigated spectral characteristics of different muscle types across time scales and their evolution with physiological states. We hypothesized that each muscle type is characterized by a specific spectral profile, reflecting muscle composition and function, that remains invariant over time scales and is universal across subjects. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the myoelectrical activation and corresponding spectral profile during certain movements exhibit an evolution path in time that is unique for each muscle type and reflects responses in muscle dynamics to exercise, fatigue, and aging. To probe the multiscale mechanism of neuromuscular regulation, we developed a novel protocol of repeated squat exercise segments, each performed until exhaustion, and we analyzed differentiated spectral power responses over a range of frequency bands for leg and back muscle activation in young and old subjects. We found that leg and back muscle activation is characterized by muscle-specific spectral profiles, with differentiated frequency band contribution, and a muscle-specific evolution path in response to fatigue and aging that is universal across subjects in each age group. The uncovered universality among subjects in the spectral profile of each muscle at a given physiological state, as well as the robustness in the evolution of these profiles over a range of time scales and states, reveals a previously unrecognized multiscale mechanism underlying the differentiated response of distinct muscle types to exercise-induced fatigue and aging. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY To understand coordinated function of distinct fibers in a muscle, we investigated spectral dynamics of muscle activation during maximal exercise across a range of frequency bands and time scales of observation. We discovered a spectral profile that is specific for each muscle type, robust at short, intermediate, and large time scales, universal across subjects, and characterized by a muscle-specific evolution path with accumulation of fatigue and aging, indicating a previously unrecognized multiscale mechanism of muscle tone regulation.},

To understand the multiscale dynamics of neuromuscular activity, we investigate spectral characteristics of different muscle types across timescales, and we track the evolution of the dynamics with progression of exercise and fatigue. We develop a protocol for young and elderly subjects of repeated squat exercise segments performed until exhaustion. We analyze differentiated spectral power responses over a range of frequency bands representing muscle fiber dynamics within leg and back muscle activation. We find that leg and back muscle are characterized by muscle-specific spectral profiles with differentiated frequency bands contribution and a muscle-specific evolution path in response to acute fatigue. Specifically, we observe that with increasing fatigue leg muscle spectral power increases for low, intermediate and high frequencies. In contrast, back muscle spectral power increases with fatigue only for low and intermediate frequencies below 50 Hz. Further, leg muscle shows higher spectral response to fatigue (35\% and 40\% for young and elderly subjects respectively; p {$<$} 0.05) compared to the back muscle (25\% increase only for the young group; p = 0.03). The uncovered universality among subjects in the spectral profile, reveals a previously unrecognized multi-scale mechanism underlying differentiated response of distinct muscle types and muscle fibers to exercise-induced fatigue in young and elderly. Tracking changes in the spectral profiles could help quantify more precisely muscle adaptations after training interventions and may assist coaches with the selection of most appropriate and effective training programs.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) models for decision support have been developed for clinical settings such as radiology, but little work evaluates the potential impact of such systems. In this study, physicians received chest X-rays and diagnostic advice, some of which was inaccurate, and were asked to evaluate advice quality and make diagnoses. All advice was generated by human experts, but some was labeled as coming from an AI system. As a group, radiologists rated advice as lower quality when it appeared to come from an AI system; physicians with less task-expertise did not. Diagnostic accuracy was significantly worse when participants received inaccurate advice, regardless of the purported source. This work raises important considerations for how advice, AI and non-AI, should be deployed in clinical environments.},

  abstract = {Following a program of resistance training, there are neural and muscular contributions to the gain in strength. Here, we measured changes in important central motor pathways during strength training in 2 female macaque monkeys. Animals were trained to pull a handle with one arm; weights could be added to increase load. On each day, motor-evoked potentials in upper limb muscles were first measured after stimulation of the primary motor cortex (M1), corticospinal tract (CST), and reticulospinal tract (RST). Monkeys then completed 50 trials with weights progressively increased over 8-9 weeks (final weight {$\sim$}6 kg, close to the animal's body weight). Muscle responses to M1 and RST stimulation increased during strength training; there were no increases in CST responses. Changes persisted during a 2 week washout period without weights. After a further 3 months of strength training, an experiment under anesthesia mapped potential responses to CST and RST stimulation in the cervical enlargement of the spinal cord. We distinguished the early axonal volley and later spinal synaptic field potentials, and used the slope of the relationship between these at different stimulus intensities as a measure of spinal input-output gain. Spinal gain was increased on the trained compared with the untrained side of the cord within the intermediate zone and motor nuclei for RST, but not CST, stimulation. We conclude that neural adaptations to strength training involve adaptations in the RST, as well as intracortical circuits within M1. By contrast, there appears to be little contribution from the CST. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We provide the first report of a strength training intervention in nonhuman primates. Our results indicate that strength training is associated with neural adaptations in intracortical and reticulospinal circuits, whereas corticospinal and motoneuronal adaptations are not dominant factors.},

Prediction of fatigue onset, and even quantifying the fatigue level could be utilized in assistive controllers in rehabilitation robots to elongate the sessions. In this research, the fatigue onset prediction and fatigue level recognition were studied on healthy subjects performing squat motions while using an exergame. Different analysis methods where investigated based on the collected data in a developed procedure. The phasing analysis method was developed by analyzing each squat phase. The appropriate muscle activity values were extracted from the data and combined for further classification and regression analysis. The classification analysis goal was to create a model for detecting the onset of fatigue, whereas the regression analysis would predict the fatigue level. Random forest performed best in both analyses.},

Lower-limb dynamics of muscle oxygen saturation during the back-squat exercise: effects of training load and effort level. J Strength Cond Res 34(5): 1227\textendash 1236, 2020\textemdash The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of strength training on lower limb muscle oxygenation. The sample consisted of 12 male subjects (22.4 {$\pm$} 1.73 years; 1.81 {$\pm$} 0.08 cm height and 77.76 {$\pm$} 8.77 kg body mass). Six different strength training stimuli were analyzed, based on the training variables: load (60\textendash 75\% 1 repetition maximum [1RM]) and level of effort (LE) (E1: 4 \texttimes{} 8 [20RM], E2: 4 \texttimes{} 12 [20RM], E3: 4 \texttimes{} 16 [20RM], E4: 4 \texttimes{} 4 [10RM], E5: 4 \texttimes{} 6 [10RM], and E6: 4 \texttimes{} 8 [10RM]) in the squat exercise up to 90\textdegree{} with a 2-second stop between repetitions to avoid the myotatic reflex. Oxygen saturation at the beginning of the series (SmO2start), oxygen saturation at the end of the series (SmO2stop), percentage of oxygen saturation loss ({$\bigtriangledown\%$}SmO2), and reoxygenation time (SmO2recT) were assessed using a near-infrared spectroscopy device. In addition, the percentage of mean propulsive velocity loss (\%MPVL) was recorded using a linear transducer. The results suggested an influence of LE and training load on muscle oxygenation. A greater LE was directly associated with SmO2recT (r = 0.864), {$\bigtriangledown\%$}SmO2 (r = 0.873), and \%MPVL (r = 0.883) and inversely with SmO2stop (r = -0.871). When the same LE was used (E1 vs. E4, E2 vs. E5, and E3 vs. E6), it was found that the stimuli with a higher load had a lower SmO2recT, {$\bigtriangledown\%$}SmO2, and \%MPVL and a higher SmO2stop. Muscle oxygen saturation was found to be minimal (\%SmO2 = 0) in stimuli with a LE greater than 60\% (E3 and E6). The SmO2 variables studied in the present research could be considered as an easier and more useful method for understanding skeletal muscle fatigue during resistance training.},

One hundred and twenty strength-trained males performed a test (T1) with increasing loads for the individual determination of the one-repetition maximum (1RM) and full load-velocity profile. Fifty-six subjects performed the test on a second occasion (T2) following 6 weeks of training. A very close relationship between mean propulsive velocity (MPV) and load (\%1RM) was observed (R (2)=0.98). Mean velocity attained with 1RM was 0.16+/-0.04 m x s(-1) and was found to influence the MPV attained with each \%1RM. Despite a mean increase of 9.3\% in 1RM from T1 to T2, MPV for each \%1RM remained stable. Stability in the load-velocity relationship was also confirmed regardless of individual relative strength. These results confirm an inextricable relationship between relative load and MPV in the BP that makes it possible to: 1) evaluate maximal strength without the need to perform a 1RM test, or test of maximum number of repetitions to failure (XRM); 2) determine the \%1RM that is being used as soon as the first repetition with any given load is performed; 3) prescribe and monitor training load according to velocity, instead of percentages of 1RM or XRM.},

Fifteen trained subjects performed five sets consisting of 10 leg press, with 2min rest between sets. sEMG was recorded from vastus medialis (VM) muscle. Several surface electromyographic parameters were computed. These were: mean rectified voltage (MRV), median spectral frequency (Fmed), Dimitrov spectral index of muscle fatigue (FInsm5), as well as five other parameters obtained from the stationary wavelet transform (SWT) as ratios between different scales. The new wavelet indices showed better accuracy to map changes in muscle power output during the fatiguing protocol. Moreover, the new wavelet indices as a single parameter predictor accounted for 46.6\% of the performance variance of changes in muscle power and the log-FInsm5 and MRV as a two-factor combination predictor accounted for 49.8\%. On the other hand, the new wavelet indices proposed, showed the highest robustness in presence of additive white Gaussian noise for different signal to noise ratios (SNRs).

In this study, we investigated the impact caused by prescribing misleading intensities of resistance exercise on acute electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) responses and the total number of repetitions to exhaustion. Collegiate female students performed three sets of biceps curls to exhaustion. The actual intensity for all sets was set at 65\% 1-Repetition Maximum (1-RM). However, participants were deceptively informed that the intensities were 60\%, 65\%, or 70\% 1-RM. The number of repetitions to fatigue and the magnitude of EEG and EMG signals were analyzed. The number of repetitions to exhaustion was significantly lower in greater announced intensities (18.11~{$\pm~$}8.44) compared to lower (29.76~{$\pm~$}16.28; p~=~0.017) and correctly (27.82~{$\pm~$}11.01; p~=~0.001) announced intensity. The correlation between frontal and motor-cortex signals was significant in lower (r~=~0.72, p~=~0.001) and higher (r~=~0.64, p~=~0.005) announced intensities. The median and mean frequencies of EMG signal and Root Mean Square (RMS) did not show any significant difference between sets, but the peak-to-peak range (PPR) of biceps EMG signals was significantly higher in lower intensity (0.145~{$\pm~$}0.042) when compared with higher (0.104~{$\pm~$}0.044; p~=~0.028) or correctly (0.126~{$\pm~$}0.048; p~=~0.037) announced intensity.

As an example of typical data where such analyses have proven useful, we apply the methods to the Arctic Oscillation index and the Baltic maximum sea ice extent record.

All subjects were familiarized with the isometric midthigh clean pull and participated in regular strength training. Two isometric midthigh clean pulls were performed with 2 minutes rest between each trail. All measures were performed in a custom isometric testing device that included a step-wise adjustable bar and a force plate for measuring ground reaction forces. The RFD during predetermined time zone bands (0\textendash 30, 0\textendash 50, 0\textendash 90, 0\textendash 100, 0\textendash 150, 0\textendash 200, and 0\textendash 250 milliseconds) was then calculated by dividing the force at the end of the band by the band's time interval. The peak RFD was then calculated with the use of 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 50 milliseconds sampling windows. The average RFD (avgRFD) was calculated by dividing the peak force (PF) by the time to achieve PF.

All predetermined RFD time bands were deemed reliable based on an ICC{$\alpha$} {$>$}0.95 and a CV {$<$}4\%. Conversely, the avgRFD failed to meet the reliability standards set for this study. Overall, the method used to assess the RFD during an isometric midthigh clean pull impacts the reliability of the measure and predetermined RFD time bands should be used to quantify the RFD.},

Guided by the site and quality of the insertion paresthesias and by the site quality of adequate peripheral stimuli required to evoke afferent discharges one could judge when muscle afferent nerve fibers lay close to the electrode tip. Multifiber neurograms obtained from 20 such recording sites were analyzed. The neural events occurring in response to local pressure or vibration on the muscle or its tendon, passive muscle stretch, tendon taps, and electrically induced twitches were compared to the discharge patterns appearing during fast and sustained voluntary contraction. A major part of the afferent neural activity encountered in these experiments derives from intramuscular length-receptors. In spite of the complexity of these multifiber recordings, some preliminary deductions concerning the characteristics of muscle end-organs in man and the role played by the fusimotor system in voluntary contractions were made.},

Beyond a critical frequency the originally prepared out-of-phase, antisymmetric mode is replaced by a symmetrical, in-phase mode involving simultaneous activation of homologous muscle groups. Qualitavely, these phase transitions are analogous to gait shifts in animal locomotion as well as phenomena common to other physical and biological systems in which new ``modes'' or spatiotemporal patterns arise when the system is parametrically scaled beyond its equilibrium state (Haken, 1983). In this paper a theoretical model, using concepts central to the interdisciplinary field of synergetics and nonlinear oscillator theory, is developed, which reproduces (among other features) the dramatic change in coordinative pattern observed between the hands.},

  abstract = {In this study, the dynamic contractions and the associated fatigue condition in biceps brachii muscle are analysed using Synchrosqueezed Wavelet Transform (SST) and singular value features of surface Electromyography (sEMG) signals. For this, the recorded signals are decomposed into time-frequency matrix using SST. Two analytic functions namely Morlet and Bump wavelets are utilised for the analysis. Singular Value Decomposition method is applied to this time-frequency matrix to derive the features such as Maximum Singular Value (MSV), Singular Value Entropy (SVEn) and Singular Value Energy (SVEr). The results show that both these wavelets are able to characterise nonstationary variations in sEMG signals during dynamic fatiguing contractions. Increase in values of MSV and SVEr with the progression of fatigue denotes the presence of nonstationarity in the sEMG signals. The lower values of SVEn with the progression of fatigue indicate the randomness in the signal. Thus, it appears that the proposed approach could be used to characterise dynamic muscle contractions under varied neuromuscular conditions.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Unilateral resistance training produces strength gains in the untrained homologous muscle group, an effect termed ``cross-education.'' The observed strength transfer has traditionally been considered a phenomenon of the nervous system, with few studies examining the contribution of factors beyond the brain and spinal cord. In this hypothesis and theory article, we aim to discuss further evidence for structural and functional adaptations occurring within the nervous, muscle, and endocrine systems in response to unilateral resistance training. The limitations of existing cross-education studies will be explored, and novel potential stakeholders that may contribute to the cross-education effect will be identified.Design: Critical review of the literature.Method: Search of online databases.Results: Studies have provided evidence that functional reorganization of the motor cortex facilitates, at least in part, the effects of cross-education. Cross-activation of the ``untrained'' motor cortex, ipsilateral to the trained limb, plays an important role. While many studies report little or no gains in muscle mass in the untrained limb, most experimental designs have not allowed for sensitive or comprehensive investigation of structural changes in the muscle.Conclusions: Increased neural drive originating from the ``untrained'' motor cortex contributes to the cross-education effect. Adaptive changes within the muscle fiber, as well as systemic and hormonal factors require further investigation. An increased understanding of the physiological mechanisms contributing to cross-education will enable to more effectively explore its effects and potential applications in rehabilitation of unilateral movement disorders or injury.},

  abstract = {The knowledge of surface electromyography (SEMG) and the number of applications have increased considerably during the past ten years. However, most methodological developments have taken place locally, resulting in different methodologies among the different groups of users.A specific objective of the European concerted action SENIAM (surface EMG for a non-invasive assessment of muscles) was, besides creating more collaboration among the various European groups, to develop recommendations on sensors, sensor placement, signal processing and modeling. This paper will present the process and the results of the development of the recommendations for the SEMG sensors and sensor placement procedures. Execution of the SENIAM sensor tasks, in the period 1996-1999, has been handled in a number of partly parallel and partly sequential activities. A literature scan was carried out on the use of sensors and sensor placement procedures in European laboratories. In total, 144 peer-reviewed papers were scanned on the applied SEMG sensor properties and sensor placement procedures. This showed a large variability of methodology as well as a rather insufficient description. A special workshop provided an overview on the scientific and clinical knowledge of the effects of sensor properties and sensor placement procedures on the SEMG characteristics. Based on the inventory, the results of the topical workshop and generally accepted state-of-the-art knowledge, a first proposal for sensors and sensor placement procedures was defined. Besides containing a general procedure and recommendations for sensor placement, this was worked out in detail for 27 different muscles. This proposal was evaluated in several European laboratories with respect to technical and practical aspects and also sent to all members of the SENIAM club ({$>$}100 members) together with a questionnaire to obtain their comments. Based on this evaluation the final recommendations of SENIAM were made and published (SENIAM 8: European recommendations for surface electromyography, 1999), both as a booklet and as a CD-ROM. In this way a common body of knowledge has been created on SEMG sensors and sensor placement properties as well as practical guidelines for the proper use of SEMG.},

Regarding cognitive functions, substantial functional (e.g., compensatory brain activity) and structural changes (e.g., shrinking of the hippocampus) in the brain cause this decline. Notably, growing evidence points towards a relationship between cognition and measures of muscular strength and muscle mass. Based on this emerging evidence, resistance exercises and/or resistance training, which contributes to the preservation and augmentation of muscular strength and muscle mass, may trigger beneficial neurobiological processes and could be crucial for healthy aging that includes preservation of the brain and cognition. Compared with the multitude of studies that have investigated the influence of endurance exercises and/or endurance training on cognitive performance and brain structure, considerably less work has focused on the effects of resistance exercises and/or resistance training. While the available evidence regarding resistance exercise-induced changes in cognitive functions is pooled, the underlying neurobiological processes, such as functional and structural brain changes, have yet to be summarized. Hence, the purpose of this systematic review is to provide an overview of resistance exercise-induced functional and/or structural brain changes that are related to cognitive functions.},

However, the neurophysiological correlates of this relationship are not well understood so far. The aim of this study was to investigate cortical hemodynamics [i.e., changes in concentrations of oxygenated (oxyHb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxyHb)] as a possible link between measures of muscular strength and cognitive performance. METHODS: In a cohort of younger adults (n\,=\,39, 18-30~years), we assessed (i) handgrip strength by a handhold dynamometer, (ii) short-term working memory performance by using error rates and reaction times in the Sternberg task, and (iii) cortical hemodynamics of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) via functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). RESULTS: We observed low to moderate negative correlations (rp\,=\,\,\textasciitilde\,-\,0.38 to -\,0.51; p\,{$<$}\,0.05) between reaction time and levels of oxyHb in specific parts of the PFC. Furthermore, we noticed low to moderate positive correlations (rp\,=\,\,\textasciitilde\,0.34 to 0.45; p\,{$<$}\,0.05) between reaction times and levels of deoxyHb in distinct parts of the PFC. Additionally, higher levels of oxyHb (rp (35)\,=\,0.401; p\,=\,0.014) and lower levels of deoxyHb (rp (34)\,=\,-\,0.338; p\,=\,0.043) in specific parts of the PFC were linked to higher percentage of correct answers. We also found low to moderate correlations (p\,{$<$}\,0.05) between measures of handgrip strength and levels of oxyHb (rp\,=\,\,\textasciitilde\,0.35; p\,{$<$}\,0.05) and levels of deoxyHb (rp\,=\,\,\textasciitilde\,-\,0.25 to -\,0.49; p\,{$<$}\,0.05) in specific parts of the PFC. However, there was neither a correlation between cognitive performance and handgrip strength nor did cortical hemodynamics in the PFC mediate the relationship between handgrip strength and cognitive performance (p\,{$>$}\,0.05). CONCLUSION: The present study provides evidence for a positive neurobehavioral relationship between cortical hemodynamics and cognitive performance. Our~findings~further imply that in younger adults higher levels of handgrip strength positively~influence cortical hemodynamics although the latter did not necessarily culminate in better cognitive performance. Future research should examine whether the present findings can be generalized to other cohorts (e.g., older adults).},

Purpose~         The mechanisms that underlie the affect of acute program variables on muscle growth and strength development for strength/power athletes have been of great interest. This investigation examined the affects of two different resistance exercise protocols on muscle oxygenation, and the anabolic hormonal response to such exercise.         Methods~         Eleven experienced resistance-trained male athletes performed four sets of the squat exercise using either a low-intensity, high-volume (LI; 15 repetitions at 60\% one-repetition maximum [1-RM]) or high-intensity, low-volume (HI; 4 repetitions at 90\% 1-RM) load. Venous blood samples were obtained before (Pre), immediate (IP), 20- (20P), and 40-min (40P) postexercise. Continuous-wave near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure oxygen desaturation during exercise.         Results~         No differences in muscle deoxygenation were seen between LI and HI. However, time-dependent postexercise reoxygenation was significantly different between the two exercise sessions (35.3 {$\pm$} 17.4 s vs 24.5 {$\pm$} 14.3 s in LI and HI, respectively). Testosterone and growth hormone (GH) concentrations were significantly elevated from Pre at IP, 20P, and 40P in both LI and HI. GH concentrations were higher (P {$<$} 0.05) for LI than at HI at 20P and 40P.         Conclusion~         Muscle oxygen recovery kinetics appeared to be influenced by differences in the intensity and volume of exercise, and delayed reoxygenation appears to affect the GH response to exercise.},

  abstract = {Hand motor tasks are frequently used to assess impaired motor function in neurology and neurorehabilitation. Assessments can be varied by means of hand laterality, i.e. unimanual or bimanual performance, as well as by means of task complexity, i.e. different degrees ranging from simple to complex sequence tasks. The resulting functional activation in human primary motor cortex (M1) has been studied intensively by traditional neuroimaging methods. Previous studies using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) investigated simple hand motor tasks. However, it is unknown whether fNIRS can also detect changes in response to increasing task complexity. Our hypothesis was to show that fNIRS could detect activation changes in relation to task complexity in uni- and bimanual tasks. Sixteen healthy right-handed subjects performed five finger-tapping tasks: unimanual left and right, simple and complex tasks as well as bimanual complex tasks. We found significant differences in oxy-hemoglobin (O2Hb) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HHb) concentration in the right hemisphere over M1. Largest O2Hb concentration changes were found during complex (0.351{$\pm$}0.051~{$\mu$}mol/l) and simple (0.275{$\pm$}0.054~{$\mu$}mol/l) right hand tasks followed by bimanual (0.249{$\pm$}0.047~{$\mu$}mol/l), complex (0.154{$\pm$}0.034~{$\mu$}mol/l) and simple (0.110{$\pm$}0.034~{$\mu$}mol/l) left hand tasks. Largest HHb concentration changes were found during bimanual (-0.138{$\pm$}0.006~{$\mu$}mol/l) tasks, followed by simple right hand (-0.12{$\pm$}0.016~{$\mu$}mol/l), complex left (-0.0875{$\pm$}0.007~{$\mu$}mol/l), complex right (-0.0863{$\pm$}0.005~{$\mu$}mol/l) and simple left (-0.0674{$\pm$}0.005~{$\mu$}mol/l) hand tasks. We report for the first time that fNIRS detects oxygenation changes in relation to task complexity during finger-tapping.

Effects of fatigue from resistance training on barbell back squat biomechanics. J Strength Cond Res 28(4): 1127\textendash 1134, 2014\textemdash Exhaustive resistance training programs that have been previously referred to as extreme conditioning protocols have increased in popularity in military and civilian populations in recent years. However, because of their highly fatiguing nature, proprioception is likely altered during such programs that would significantly affect the safety and efficacy of such programs. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the alterations in movement patterns that result from extreme conditioning protocols and to evaluate if these protocols can be deemed safe and effective. Twelve men (age 24 {$\pm$} 4.2 years, height 173.1 {$\pm$} 3.6 cm, weight 76.9 {$\pm$} 7.8 kg, body fat percentage 9.0 {$\pm$} 2.2\%) and 13 women (age 24.5 {$\pm$} 3.8 years, height 166.9 {$\pm$} 8.5 cm, weight 66.1 {$\pm$} 9.2 kg, body fat percentage 18.6 {$\pm$} 4.0\%) with at least 6 months of resistance training experience involving barbell bench press, barbell deadlift, and barbell back squat performed a highly fatiguing resistance training workout. During the barbell back squat, a 2-dimensional analysis was performed where the knee and hip angles were recorded throughout the 55 repetitions of the workout. At the early stages of the protocol, knee angle was significantly lower in men and in women demonstrating less knee flexion. Also, hip angle was significantly lower early in the program in men and in women, demonstrating a greater forward lean. The technique changes that occur in high repetition sets do not favor optimal strength development and may increase the risk of injury, clearly questioning the safety and efficacy of such resistance training programming. This is likely a display of self-preservation by individuals who are faced with high repetition programs.},

Twelve men randomly performed three experimental sessions on different days, i.e. one single 10~s all-out sprint and two trials of 10~\texttimes ~10~s all-out sprints with 30~s of passive recovery in between. One trial was performed in the unfatigued state (CTRL) and one following electrically induced quadriceps muscle fatigue (FTNMES). Peripheral fatigue was quantified by comparing pre- with postexercise changes in potentiated quadriceps twitch force ({$\Delta$}Qtw-pot) evoked by supramaximal magnetic stimulation of the femoral nerve. Central fatigue was estimated by comparing pre- with postexercise voluntary activation of quadriceps motor units. The root mean square (RMS) of the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis EMG normalized to maximal M-wave amplitude (RMS.Mmax (-1)) was also calculated during sprints. Compared with CTRL condition, pre-existing quadriceps muscle fatigue in FTNMES ({$\Delta$}Qtw-pot~=~-29~{$\pm~$}4\%) resulted in a significant (P~{$<~$}0.05) reduction in power output (-4.0~{$\pm~$}0.9\%) associated with a reduction in RMS.Mmax (-1). However, {$\Delta$}Qtw-pot postsprints decreased by 51\% in both conditions, indicating that the level of peripheral fatigue was identical and independent of the degree of pre-existing fatigue. Our findings show that power output and cycling EMG are adjusted during exercise in order to limit the development of peripheral fatigue beyond a constant threshold. We hypothesize that the contribution of peripheral fatigue to exercise limitation involves a reduction in central motor drive in addition to the impairment in muscular function.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of changes in exercise intensity and speed on the three heads of the triceps brachii (TB) during triceps push-down exercise until task failure. Twenty-five subjects performed triceps push-down exercise at three different intensities (30, 45, and 60\% 1RM) and speeds (slow, medium, and fast) until failure, and surface electromyography (sEMG) signals were recorded from the lateral, long and medial heads of the TB. The endurance time (ET), number of repetitions (NR) and rate of fatigue (ROF) were analyzed. Subsequently, the root-mean-square (RMS), mean power frequency (MPF) and median frequency (MDF) under no-fatigue (NF) and fatigue (Fa) conditions were statistically compared. The findings reveal that ROF increases with increase in the intensity and speed, and the opposite were obtained for the ET. The ROF in the three heads were comparable for all intensities and speeds. The ROF showed a significant difference (P {$<$} 0.05) among the three intensities and speeds for all heads. The three heads showed significantly different (P {$<$} 0.05) MPF and MDF values for all the performed exercises under both conditions, whereas the RMS values were significantly different only under Fa conditions. The current observations suggest that exercise intensity and speed affect the ROF while changes in intensity do not affect the MPF and MDF under Fa conditions. The behavior of the spectral parameters indicate that the three heads do not work in unison under any of the conditions. Changes in the speed of triceps push-down exercise affects the lateral and long heads, but changes in the exercise intensity affected the attributes of all heads to a greater extent.},

Recent advances in many aspects (single unit and field potential recordings in animals, intracranial recording of MRCPs in epileptic patients, magnetoencephalography, and positron emission tomography) have provided new information about the physiological significance of MRCPs. In contrast to the findings on scalp recordings, in which the early potentials prior to movement onset are seen more widely, the main cortical generators appear to be discretely localized in bilateral primary and supplementary motor areas with a contra-lateral predominance. This review outlines the findings in scalp-recorded MRCPs and compares them with the results of invasive recordings, paying special attention to their physiological significance.},

  abstract = {The human organism is an integrated network of interconnected and interacting organ systems, each representing a separate regulatory network. The behavior of one physiological system (network) may affect the dynamics of all other systems in the network of physiologic networks. Due to these interactions, failure of one system can trigger a cascade of failures throughout the entire network. We introduce a systematic method to identify a network of interactions between diverse physiologic organ systems, to quantify the hierarchical structure and dynamics of this network, and to track its evolution under different physiologic states. We find a robust relation between network structure and physiologic states: every state is characterized by specific network topology, node connectivity and links strength. Further, we find that transitions from one physiologic state to another trigger a markedly fast reorganization in the network of physiologic interactions on time scales of just a few minutes, indicating high network flexibility in response to perturbations. This reorganization in network topology occurs simultaneously and globally in the entire network as well as at the level of individual physiological systems, while preserving a hierarchical order in the strength of network links. Our findings highlight the need of an integrated network approach to understand physiologic function, since the framework we develop provides new information which can not be obtained by studying individual systems. The proposed system-wide integrative approach may facilitate the development of a new field, Network Physiology.},

Methods:~           Twelve trained subjects performed five sets consisting of 10 repetitions in the leg press, with 2 min of rest between sets before and after a strength training period. sEMG variables (the mean average voltage, the median spectral frequency, and the Dimitrov spectral index of muscle fatigue) from vastus medialis and lateralis muscles and metabolic responses (i.e., blood lactate, uric acid, and ammonia concentrations) were measured.           Results:~           The peak power loss after the posttraining protocol was greater (61\%) than the decline observed in the pretraining protocol (46\%). Similar sEMG changes were found for both protocols, whereas higher metabolic demand was observed during the posttraining exercise. The linear models on the basis of the relations found between power loss and changes in sEMG variables were significantly different between pretraining and posttraining, whereas the linear models on the basis of the relations between power loss and changes in blood metabolite concentrations were similar.           Conclusions:~           Linear models that use blood metabolites to map acute exercise-induced peak power changes were more accurate in detecting these changes before and after a short-term training period, whereas an attempt to track peak power loss using sEMG variables may fail after a strength training period.},

  abstract = {Probability distributions over external states (priors) are essential to the interpretation of sensory signals. Priors for cultural artifacts such as music and language remain largely uncharacterized, but likely constrain cultural transmission, because only those signals with high probability under the prior can be reliably reproduced and communicated. We developed a method to estimate priors for simple rhythms via iterated reproduction of random temporal sequences. Listeners were asked to reproduce random ``seed'' rhythms; their reproductions were fed back as the stimulus and over time became dominated by internal biases, such that the prior could be estimated by applying the procedure multiple times. We validated that the measured prior was consistent across the modality of reproduction and that it correctly predicted perceptual discrimination. We then measured listeners' priors over the entire space of two- and three-interval rhythms. Priors in US participants showed peaks at rhythms with simple integer ratios and were similar for musicians and non-musicians. An analogous procedure produced qualitatively different results for spoken phrases, indicating some specificity to music. Priors measured in members of a native Amazonian society were distinct from those in US participants but also featured integer ratio peaks. The results do not preclude biological constraints favoring integer ratios, but they suggest that priors on musical rhythm are substantially modulated by experience and may simply reflect the empirical distribution of rhythm that listeners encounter. The proposed method can efficiently map out a high-resolution view of biases that shape transmission and stability of simple reproducible patterns within a culture.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of two fatigue protocols on landing performance. A repeated measures design was used to examine the effects of fatigue and fatigue protocol on neuromuscular and biomechanical performance variables. Ten volunteers performed non-fatigued and fatigued landings on two days using different fatigue protocols. Repeated maximum isometric squats were used to induce fatigue on day one. Sub-maximum cycling was used to induce fatigue on day two. Isometric squat maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) was measured before and after fatigued landings on each day. During the landings, ground reaction force (GRF), knee kinematics, and electromyographic (EMG) data were recorded. Isometric MVC, GRF peaks, loading rates, impulse, knee flexion at contact, range of motion, max angular velocity, and EMG root mean square (RMS) values were compared pre- and post-fatiguing exercise and between fatigue protocols using repeated ANOVA. Fatigue decreased MVC strength (p{$\leqslant$}0.05), GRF second peak, and initial impulse (p{$\leqslant$}0.01), but increased quadriceps medium latency stretch reflex EMG activity (p{$\leqslant$}0.012). Knee flexion at contact was 5.2\textdegree{} greater (p{$\leqslant$}0.05) during fatigued landings following the squat exercise compared to cycling. Several variables exhibited non-significant but large effect sizes when comparing the effects of fatigue and fatigue protocol. In conclusion, fatigue alters landing performance and different fatigue protocols result in different performance changes.},

  abstract = {We examined the neuromuscular adaptations following 3 and 6 weeks of 80 vs. 30\% one repetition maximum (1RM) resistance training to failure in the leg extensors. Twenty-six men (age = 23.1 {$\pm$} 4.7 years) were randomly assigned to a high- (80\% 1RM; n = 13) or low-load (30\% 1RM; n = 13) resistance training group and completed leg extension resistance training to failure 3 times per week for 6 weeks. Testing was completed at baseline, 3, and 6 weeks of training. During each testing session, ultrasound muscle thickness and echo intensity, 1RM strength, maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) strength, and contractile properties of the quadriceps femoris were measured. Percent voluntary activation (VA) and electromyographic (EMG) amplitude were measured during MVIC, and during randomly ordered isometric step muscle actions at 10\textendash 100\% of baseline MVIC. There were similar increases in muscle thickness from Baseline to Week 3 and 6 in the 80 and 30\% 1RM groups. However, both 1RM and MVIC strength increased from Baseline to Week 3 and 6 to a greater degree in the 80\% than 30\% 1RM group. VA during MVIC was also greater in the 80 vs. 30\% 1RM group at Week 6, and only training at 80\% 1RM elicited a significant increase in EMG amplitude during MVIC. The peak twitch torque to MVIC ratio was also significantly reduced in the 80\%, but not 30\% 1RM group, at Week 3 and 6. Finally, VA and EMG amplitude were reduced during submaximal torque production as a result of training at 80\% 1RM, but not 30\% 1RM. Despite eliciting similar hypertrophy, 80\% 1RM improved muscle strength more than 30\% 1RM, and was accompanied by increases in VA and EMG amplitude during maximal force production. Furthermore, training at 80\% 1RM resulted in a decreased neural cost to produce the same relative submaximal torques after training, whereas training at 30\% 1RM did not. Therefore, our data suggest that high-load training results in greater neural adaptations that may explain the disparate increases in muscle strength despite similar hypertrophy following high- and low-load training programs.},

The starting point of their analysis is the topological properties of the phase flow. In particular, the phenomenon of false starts provides a characteristic structural condition for the phase flow, the separatrix, which partitions the phase space. Threshold phenomena, which are characteristic of excitable systems, as well as stable and unstable fixed points and periodic orbits, are discussed. Stable manifolds in the proximity of fixed points, resulting in an overshoot and a slow return phase after movement execution, are predicted in the analysis. To investigate coordination phenomena, the authors discuss the effects of two types of couplings, the sigmoidal coupling and a truncated version thereof, known as the Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) coupling. They show analytically and numerically that the sigmoidal coupling leads to convergence phenomena in phase space, whereas the HKB coupling displays convergent as well as divergent behaviors. The authors suggest a specific representation of the excitator that allows the quantification of the predictions.},

The idea is that blood flow to the contracting muscles links oxygen in the atmosphere with the contracting muscles where it is consumed. In this context, we take a top down approach and review the basics of oxygen consumption at rest and during exercise in humans, how these values change with training, and the systemic hemodynamic adaptations that support them. We highlight the very high muscle blood flow responses to exercise discovered in the 1980s. We also discuss the vasodilating factors in the contracting muscles responsible for these very high flows. Finally, the competition between demand for blood flow by contracting muscles and maximum systemic cardiac output is discussed as a potential challenge to blood pressure regulation during heavy large muscle mass or whole body exercise in humans. At this time, no one dominant dilator mechanism accounts for exercise hyperemia. Additionally, complex interactions between the sympathetic nervous system and the microcirculation facilitate high levels of systemic oxygen extraction and permit just enough sympathetic control of blood flow to contracting muscles to regulate blood pressure during large muscle mass exercise in humans.},

The developments of different signal analysis to extract different indices for muscle fatigue assessments are reviewed in this paper. Several indices in time, frequency, and time-frequency representations for muscle fatigue assessments have been identified. However the sensitivity of those indices needs to be investigated.

In addition, the CWT method is very reliable for the analysis of nonstationary biological signals and does not require any smoothing function as do methods based on Wigner-Ville. However, using time-frequency methods involves two main tradeoffs: i.e., potential increases in performance for a given application versus computational complexity and storage requirements. Our results confirmed earlier studies that MNF is independent of angular velocity.},

We have shown that a few minutes of daily practice on a sequential finger opposition task induced large, incremental performance gains over a few weeks of training. These gains did not generalize to the contralateral hand nor to a matched sequence of identical component movements, suggesting that a lateralized representation of the learned sequence of movements evolved through practice. This interpretation was supported by functional MRI data showing that a more extensive representation of the trained sequence emerged in primary motor cortex after 3 weeks of training. The imaging data, however, also indicated important changes occurring in primary motor cortex during the initial scanning sessions, which we proposed may reflect the setting up of a task-specific motor processing routine. Here we provide behavioral and functional MRI data on experience-dependent changes induced by a limited amount of repetitions within the first imaging session. We show that this limited training experience can be sufficient to trigger performance gains that require time to become evident. We propose that skilled motor performance is acquired in several stages: "fast" learning, an initial, within-session improvement phase, followed by a period of consolidation of several hours duration, and then "slow" learning, consisting of delayed, incremental gains in performance emerging after continued practice. This time course may reflect basic mechanisms of neuronal plasticity in the adult brain that subserve the acquisition and retention of many different skills.},

The present study aimed to investigate how brain activity within the human motor system changes its processing in dependency of different barbell load conditions while executing a barbell squat (BS). Additionally, we used different fNIRS probe configurations to identify and subsequently eliminate potential exercise induced systemic confounders such as increases in extracerebral blood flow. Ten healthy, male participants were enrolled in a crossover design. Participants performed a BS task with random barbell load levels (0\% 1RM (1 repetition maximum), 20\% 1RM and 40\% 1RM for a BS) during fNIRS recordings. Initially, we observed global hemodynamic response alterations within and outside the human motor system. However, short distance channel regression of fNIRS data revealed a focalized hemodynamic response alteration within bilateral superior parietal lobe (SPL) for oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) and not for deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb) when comparing different load levels. These findings indicate that the previously observed load/force-brain relationship for simple and isolated movements is also present in complex multi-joint movements such as the BS. Altogether, our results show the feasibility of fNIRS to investigate brain processing in a sports-related context. We suggest for future studies to incorporate short distance channel regression of fNIRS data to reduce the likelihood of false-positive hemodynamic response alterations during complex whole movements.},

Participants performed 40 squats, divided into three successive movement periods (Eccentric (ECC), Isometric (ISO) and Concentric (CON)) in a standardized manner. EEG was recorded from 32 channels specifically-tailored to cover bilateral sensorimotor areas while bilateral EMG was recorded from four main muscles of BpS. We found both significant CMC and PDC (in beta and gamma bands) during BpS execution, where CMC was significantly elevated during ECC and CON when compared to ISO. Further, the dominant direction of information flow (DIF) was most prominent in EEG-EMG direction for CON and EMG-EEG direction for ECC. Collectively, we provide novel evidence that motor control during BpS is potentially achieved through central motor commands driven by a combination of directed inputs spanning across multiple frequency bands.

Participants performed 40 squats, divided into three successive movement periods (Eccentric (ECC), Isometric (ISO) and Concentric (CON)) in a standardized manner. EEG was recorded from 32 channels specifically-tailored to cover bilateral sensorimotor areas while bilateral EMG was recorded from four main muscles of BpS. We found both significant CMC and PDC (in beta and gamma bands) during BpS execution, where CMC was significantly elevated during ECC and CON when compared to ISO. Further, the dominant direction of information flow (DIF) was most prominent in EEG-EMG direction for CON and EMG-EEG direction for ECC. Collectively, we provide novel evidence that motor control during BpS is potentially achieved through central motor commands driven by a combination of directed inputs spanning across multiple frequency bands. These results serve as an important step toward a better understanding of brain-muscle relationships during multi joint compound movements.},

  abstract = {Human motor control requires the coordination of muscle activity under the anatomical constraints imposed by the musculoskeletal system. Interactions within the central nervous system are fundamental to motor coordination, but the principles governing functional integration remain poorly understood. We used network analysis to investigate the relationship between anatomical and functional connectivity among 36 muscles. Anatomical networks were defined by the physical connections between muscles, and functional networks were based on intermuscular coherence assessed during postural tasks. We found a modular structure of functional networks that was strongly shaped by the anatomical constraints of the musculoskeletal system. Changes in postural tasks were associated with a frequency-dependent reconfiguration of the coupling between functional modules. These findings reveal distinct patterns of functional interactions between muscles involved in flexibly organizing muscle activity during postural control. Our network approach to the motor system offers a unique window into the neural circuitry driving the musculoskeletal system.},

  abstract = {Strength training results in changes in skeletal muscle; however, changes in the central nervous system also occur. Over the last 15~years, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, have been used to study the neural adaptations to strength training. This review explored the hypothesis that the neural adaptations to strength training may be due to changes in corticospinal excitability and inhibition and, such changes, contribute to the gain in strength following strength training. A systematic review, according to PRISMA guidelines, identified studies by database searching, hand-searching and citation tracking between January 1990 and the first week of February 2017. Methodological quality of included studies was determined using the Downs and Black quality index. Data were synthesised and interpreted from meta-analysis. Nineteen studies investigating the corticospinal responses following strength training were included. Meta-analysis found that strength training increased strength [standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.84, 95\% CI 0.55 to 1.13], decreased short-interval intracortical inhibition (SMD -1.00, 95\% CI -1.84 to -0.17) and decreased the cortical silent period (SMD -0.66, 95\% CI -1.00 to -0.32). Strength training had no effect on motor threshold (SMD -0.12, 95\% CI -0.49 to 0.25), but a borderline effect for increased corticospinal excitability (SMD 0.27, 95\% CI 0.00 to 0.54). In untrained healthy participants, the corticospinal response to strength training is characterised by reduced intracortical inhibition and cortical silent period duration, rather than changes in corticospinal excitability. These data demonstrate that strength training targets intracortical inhibitory networks within the primary motor cortex (M1) and corticospinal pathway, characterising an important neural adaptation to strength training.},

Alternatively, electrical stimulation techniques such as the Hoffman reflex, volitional wave, and maximal wave have provided evidence of central nervous system changes at the spinal level. For 25 years, the technique of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has allowed for noninvasive supraspinal measurement of the human nervous system in a number of areas such as fatigue, skill acquisition, clinical neurophysiology, and neurology. However, it has only been within the last decade that this technique has been used to assess neural changes after strength training. The aim of this brief review is to provide an overview of TMS, discuss specific strength training studies that have investigated changes, after short-term strength training in healthy populations in upper and lower limbs, and conclude with further research suggestions and the application of this knowledge for the strength and conditioning coach.},

Throughout the study, the older group was 30\% less strong than the young group (p=0.02). The training protocol was effective in both groups with overall isometric strength gains of 30 and 36\% in the older (p=0.01) and young (p{$<$}0.01) groups, respectively. 10-RM training loads increased by 66\% in the old group (p{$<$}0.01) and by 77\% in the young group (p{$<$}0.01) throughout training. At the first baseline test, a 2\% difference in muscular activation between groups (p=0.3) did not explain the large disparity in strength. Muscular activation increased by 2\% in both groups throughout training (p{$<$}0.01). Despite considerably less muscular strength in the older group, muscular activation was greater than 95\% of maximum and appears to be equal in both young and older individuals.

These studies have made a significant contribution to human brain imaging techniques, such as near-infrared spectroscopy and trans-magnetic stimulation. With the recent development of high resolution EEG, an extension of the 10-20 system has been proposed. This new configuration, namely the 10-10 system, allows the placement of a high number (64-256) of EEG electrodes. Here, we describe the cranio-cerebral correlations with the 10-10 system. Thanks to the development of a new EEG-MRI sensor and an automated algorithm which enables the projection of electrode positions onto the cortical surface, we studied the cortical projections in 16 healthy subjects using the Talairach stereotactic system and estimated the variability of cortical projections in a statistical way. We found that the cortical projections of the 10-10 system could be estimated with a grand standard deviation of 4.6 mm in x, 7.1 mm in y and 7.8 mm in z. We demonstrated that the variability of projections is greatest in the central region and parietal lobe and least in the frontal and temporal lobes. Knowledge of cranio-cerebral correlations with the 10-10 system should enable to increase the precision of surface brain imaging and should help electrophysiological analyses, such as localization of superficial focal cortical generators.},

It is essential to understand the correct working posture because the wrong nursing posture causes the concentrated load to the lower back. The purpose of this study is to build a framework for estimating the fatigue state from the median frequency of surface EMG to clarify the relationship between performance and fatigue due to different working postures. The tasks measured here were two movements of lifting heavy objects: Stoop, which involves lifting with the force of the waist, and Squat, which involves lifting with the force of the legs. Ten healthy adults were measured in the experiment. There was no difference in the average number of lifting movements of the subjects, 36.2 for Stoop and 35.9 for Squat. However, the number of times the subjects with shallow lumbar flexion angle in Squat was recorded much higher than the average. Single regression analysis of the intermediate frequencies of the surface EMG showed that the slope of the intermediate frequency of the Stoop movement was large, except for the right erector spinae muscle. These results suggest that that movements using leg force rather than lower back force would reduce the risk of low back pain.},

Commonly applied definitions focus on the stratification of patients, sometimes referred to as a novel taxonomy, and this is derived using large-scale data including clinical, lifestyle, genetic and further biomarker information, thus going beyond the classical "signs-and-symptoms" approach.While these aspects are relevant, this description leaves open a number of questions. For example, when does precision medicine begin? In which way does the stratification of patients translate into better healthcare? And can precision medicine be viewed as the end-point of a novel stratification of patients, as implied, or is it rather a greater whole?To clarify this, the aim of this paper is to provide a more comprehensive definition that focuses on precision medicine as a process. It will be shown that this proposed framework incorporates the derivation of novel taxonomies and their role in healthcare as part of the cycle, but also covers related terms.},

This study compared differences in volume lifted and muscle activity between a rest-pause vs. traditional protocol. METHODS: Trained females (N\,=\,13) completed both a rest-pause and traditional squat protocol consisting of four sets to movement failure at 80\% pretest 1 repetition maximum load with 2-min rest between sets. Total volume and muscle activity of the vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, rectus femoris, and gluteus maximus were measured on both training days. Differences in muscle activity were viewed as a percent change (\%{$\increment$}). RESULTS: A paired samples t test indicated total volume lifted was higher in the rest-pause compared to the traditional protocol (2532 vs. 2036~kg; p\,{$<$}\,.05). Furthermore, paired samples t tests showed muscle activity \%{$\increment$} of the gluteus maximus was greater in the traditional protocol compared to the rest-pause protocol (p\,{$<$}\,.05). No other muscle activity differences were observed in the remaining muscles. CONCLUSIONS: The rest-pause allows for greater volume lifted via increased repetitions compared to a traditional protocol in trained women. The rest-pause method may be superior to a traditional method of training during a hypertrophy mesocycle, where a primary focus is total volume lifted. Furthermore, \%{$\increment$} muscle activity in the GM will be greater while performing a traditional back squat protocol in comparison to a rest-pause.},

  abstract = {The ability to perform forceful muscle contractions has important implications in sports performance and in activities of daily living. However, there is a lack of knowledge on adaptations in inter-muscular coordination following strength training. The purpose of the present study was therefore to assess muscle synergies before and after five weeks of bench press training. Thirty untrained male subjects were randomly allocated to a training group (TRA) or a control group (CON). Following the pretest, TRA completed five weeks of bench press training, before completing a posttest, while subjects in CON continued their normal life. During test sessions, surface electromyography (EMG) was recorded from 13 different muscles. Muscle synergies were extracted from EMG data using nonnegative matrix factorization. To evaluate differences between pretest and posttest, we performed a cross-correlation analysis and a cross-validation analysis, in which the synergy components extracted in the pretest session were recomputed, using the fixed synergy components from the posttest session. Two muscle synergies accounted for {$>$}90\% of the total variance, and reflected the concentric and eccentric phase, respectively. TRA significantly increased 3RM in bench press with 19.0\% [25;75 percentile, 10.3\%;21.7\%] (p{$<$}0.001), while no change occurred in CON. No significant differences were observed in synergy components between groups. However, decreases in correlation-values for intra-group comparisons in TRA may suggest that the synergy components changed, while this was not the case in CON. Strength and conditioning professionals may consider monitoring changes in muscle synergies in training and rehabilitation programs as a way to benchmark changes in inter-muscular coordination.},

  abstract = {The present study examines to what extent cultural background determines sensorimotor synchronization in humans. The direct comparison of Indian and French students, without particular experience in music or dance, or sport, was motivated by the hypothesis that musical exposure to different musical styles causes a variation in basic synchronization to sound function. At first rate limits of this capacity was sought, using a parametric design increasing the sound periodic frequency up to synchronization breakdown. No robust effect was found in that respect. However, another unpredicted change of the so-called negative mean asynchrony was found. Negative mean asynchrony is defined as the anticipation of movement with respect to sound, of about 40ms. The negative mean asynchrony simply disappears in Indians' participants. This result is very intriguing as negative mean asynchrony was considered ubiquitous for decades, and an invariant hallmark of human timing function. Revision of theoretical modelling of sensorimotor synchronization may be required to account to the found variation. Previous modelling attempts in terms of so-called anticipatory or delayed processes are likely to be revised. A larger adaptation to rate of events, like the one proposed by Bard Ermentrout (1991) to account for reduced phase shift in firefly Pteroptyx malaccae, offers some modelling avenues.},

Eight chronic resistance-trained (RT) and eight non-RT participants completed one experimental session including a total of 30 brief (7~s) elbow flexors isometric contractions at various force outputs [15, 25 and 40\% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)]. Before the contractions, MVC, maximal compound muscle action potential (Mmax) during 5\% MVC and active motor threshold (AMT) at the three various force outputs were recorded. MVC force of the chronic-RT group was 24\% higher than the non-RT group (p\,{$\leq$}\,0.001; {$\omega$}2\,=\,0.72). The chronic-RT group had lower AMTs at targeted forces of 15 and 25\% MVC (p\,=\,0.022 and p\,=\,0.012, respectively) compared to the non-RT group. During 25 and 40\% of MVC, the non-RT group exhibited decreased SICI in comparison to the chronic-RT group (p\,=\,0.008; {$\omega$}2\,=\,0.35 and p\,=\,0.03; {$\omega$}2\,=\,0.21, respectively). However, SICI did not differ between groups at 15\% MVC (p\,=\,0.62). In conclusion, chronic resistance training significantly reduces SICI. This suggests the presence of an adaptive process of inhibitory and facilitatory network activation, which may cancel out the SICI, allowing for increased corticomotor drive to the exercised muscle following a long period of resistance training.},

  abstract = {Blood flow (BF) increases with increasing exercise intensity in skeletal, respiratory, and cardiac muscle. In humans during maximal exercise intensities, 85\% to 90\% of total cardiac output is distributed to skeletal and cardiac muscle. During exercise BF increases modestly and heterogeneously to brain and decreases in gastrointestinal, reproductive, and renal tissues and shows little to no change in skin. If the duration of exercise is sufficient to increase body/core temperature, skin BF is also increased in humans. Because blood pressure changes little during exercise, changes in distribution of BF with incremental exercise result from changes in vascular conductance. These changes in distribution of BF throughout the body contribute to decreases in mixed venous oxygen content, serve to supply adequate oxygen to the active skeletal muscles, and support metabolism of other tissues while maintaining homeostasis. This review discusses the response of the peripheral circulation of humans to acute and chronic dynamic exercise and mechanisms responsible for these responses. This is accomplished in the context of leading the reader on a tour through the peripheral circulation during dynamic exercise. During this tour, we consider what is known about how each vascular bed controls BF during exercise and how these control mechanisms are modified by chronic physical activity/exercise training. The tour ends by comparing responses of the systemic circulation to those of the pulmonary circulation relative to the effects of exercise on the regional distribution of BF and mechanisms responsible for control of resistance/conductance in the systemic and pulmonary circulations. \textcopyright{} 2012 American Physiological Society.

  abstract = {Rehabilitation assessment is critical to determine an adequate intervention for a patient. However, the current practices of assessment mainly rely on therapist's experience, and assessment is infrequently executed due to the limited availability of a therapist. In this paper, we identified the needs of therapists to assess patient's functional abilities (e.g. alternative perspective on assessment with quantitative information on patient's exercise motions). As a result, we developed an intelligent decision support system that can identify salient features of assessment using reinforcement learning to assess the quality of motion and summarize patient specific analysis. We evaluated this system with seven therapists using the dataset from 15 patient performing three exercises. The evaluation demonstrates that our system is preferred over a traditional system without analysis while presenting more useful information and significantly increasing the agreement over therapists' evaluation from 0.6600 to 0.7108 F1-scores (\$p {$<$}0.05\$). We discuss the importance of presenting contextually relevant and salient information and adaptation to develop a human and machine collaborative decision making system.},

Past research has indicated that cortical activation during FTT is different between self-priming and cue-priming conditions. To evaluate how priming conditions affect the distribution of brain activation and the reorganization of brain function, and to investigate the differences in brain activation areas during FTT between PD patients and healthy control (HC) participants, we conducted an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on the existing literature. Analyses were based on data from 15 independent samples that included 181 participants with PD and 164 HC participants. We found that there was significantly more activation in the middle frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, post-central gyrus, superior parietal lobe, inferior parietal lobule, cerebellum, and basal ganglia during FTT in PD patients than in HCs. In self-priming conditions, PD patients had less activation in the parietal lobe and insular cortex but more activation in the cerebellum than the HCs. In cue-priming conditions, the PD patients showed less activation in the cerebellum and frontal-parietal areas and more activation in the superior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus than the HCs. Our study illustrates that cue-priming manipulations affect the distribution of activity in brain regions involved in motor control and motor performance in PD patients. In cue-priming conditions, brain activity in regions associated with perceptual processing and inhibitory control was enhanced, while sensory motor areas associated with attention and motor control were impaired.},

However, detecting workload remains constrained to instrumented exercise equipment, such as smart exercise machines or RFID-tagged free weights.This paper presents MuscleSense, an approach that estimates exercise workload by using wearable Surface Electromyography (sEMG) sensors and regression analysis. We evaluated the accuracy of several regression models and the effects of sensor placement through a 20-person user study.

This study is focusing on providing a systematic review of sport-related NEH studies with functional neuroimaging or brain stimulation while performing a sport-specific task, with the aim to answer the question: How does long-term specialized training change an athlete's brain and improve efficiency? A total of 28 studies (N = 829, Experimental Group n = 430) from 2001 to 2020 (Median = 2014, SD = 5.43) were analyzed and results were organized into four different sections: expert-novice samples, perceptual-cognitive tasks and neuroimaging technologies, efficiency paradox, and the cluster analysis. Researchers examined a wide range of sport-specific videos and multiple object tracking (MOT) specific to 18 different sports and utilized blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and electroencephalogram (EEG). Expert-novice comparisons were often adopted into investigations about the variations in general about optimal-controlled performance, neurophysiology, and behavioral brain research. Experts tended to perform at faster speeds, more accurate motor behavior, and with greater efficiency than novices. Experts report lower activity levels in the sensory and motor cortex with less energy expenditure, experts will possibly be more productive. These findings generally supported the NEH across the studies reviewed. However, an efficiency paradox and proficient brain functioning were revealed as the complementary hypothesis of the NEH. The discussion concentrates on strengths and key limitations. The conclusion highlights additional concerns and recommendations for prospective researchers aiming to investigate a broader range of populations and sports.},

It is thought that cortical signals driving the muscle to higher activation levels also increases, but this has never been experimentally demonstrated. The purpose of this study was to quantify brain activation during submaximal fatigue muscle contractions using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twelve volunteers performed a sustained handgrip contraction for 225 s and 320 intermittent handgrip contractions ({$\sim$}960 s) at 30\% maximal level while their brain was imaged. For the sustained contraction, EMG signals of the finger flexor muscles increased linearly while the target force was maintained. The fMRI-measured cortical activities in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex increased sharply during the first 150 s, then plateaued during the last 75 s. For the intermittent contractions, the EMG signals increased during the first 660 s and then began to decline, while the handgrip force also showed a sign of decrease despite maximal effort to maintain the force. The fMRI signal of the contralateral sensorimotor area showed a linear rise for most part of the task and plateaued at the end. For both the tasks, the fMRI signals in the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex, prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, supplementary motor area, and cerebellum exhibited steady increases. These results showed that the brain increased its output to reinforce the muscle for the continuation of the performance and possibly to process additional sensory information.},

Calibration and test experiments were conducted to characterize the sensor developed. To test the accuracy of the new measurement system, validation experiments by using the reference measurements of a commercially available measurement system were performed in a gait laboratory, where a stationary force plate, a motion capture system based on high-speed cameras and a motion track system of XSENS were adopted to analyze human movements. Experimental results supported the proposal that the developed system can be used to measure triaxial GRF and orientations with an acceptable precision during successive walking gait.},

  abstract = {Cortical-muscular functional coupling reflects the interaction between the cerebral cortex and the muscle activities. Corticomuscular coherence (CMC) has been extensively revealed in sustained contractions of various upper- and lower-limb muscles during static and dynamic force outputs. However, it is not well-understood that the CMC modulation mechanisms, i.e., the relation between a cerebral hemisphere and dynamic motor controlling limbs at constant speeds, such as isokinetic movement. In this paper, we explore the CMC between upper arm flexors/extensors movement and motor cortex during isometric exercise and cyclically isokinetic movement. We also provide further insights of frequency-shift and the neural pathway mechanisms in isokinetic movement by evaluating the coherence between motor cortex and agonistic or antagonistic muscles. This study is the first to investigate the relationship between cortical-muscular functional connections in elbow flexion-extension movement with constant speeds. The result shows that gamma-range coherence for isokinetic movement is greatly increased compared with isometric exercise, and significant CMC is observed in the entire flexion-extension stage regardless the nature of muscles contraction, although dominant synchronization of cortical oscillation and muscular activity resonated in sustained contraction stage principally. Besides, the CMC for extensors and flexors are explicitly consistent in contraction stage during cyclically isokinetic elbow movement. It is concluded that cortical-muscular coherence can be dynamically modulated as well as selective by cognitive demands of the body, and the time-varying mechanisms of the synchronous motor oscillation exist in healthy individuals during dynamic movement.},

As an index of functional connections between the cortex and muscles, CMC research is the focus of neurophysiology in recent years. Although CMC has been extensively studied in healthy subjects and sports disorders, the purpose of its applications is still ambiguous, and the magnitude of CMC varies among individuals. Here, we aim to investigate factors that modulate the variation of CMC amplitude and compare significant CMC between these factors to find a well-developed research prospect. In the present review, we discuss the mechanism of CMC and propose a general definition of CMC. Factors affecting CMC are also summarized as follows: experimental design, band frequencies and force levels, age correlation, and difference between healthy controls and patients. In addition, we provide a detailed overview of the current CMC applications for various motor disorders. Further recognition of the factors affecting CMC amplitude can clarify the physiological mechanism and is beneficial to the implementation of CMC clinical methods.},

We compared corticospinal excitability and motor representation assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) between long-term resistance trained (LRT, {$\geq$}3~years) versus untrained (UNT) males (n~=~15/group). Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were obtained from the biceps brachii during isometric elbow flexion. Stimulus-response curves were created at the hotspot during 10\% maximum voluntary torque (MVT) contractions. Maximum peak-to-peak MEP amplitude (MEPmax) was acquired with 100\% stimulator output intensity, whilst 25\%-100\% MVT was produced. Maps were created during 10\% MVT contractions, with an individualised TMS intensity eliciting 20\% MEPmax at the hotspot. LRT had a 48\% lower stimulus-response curve slope than UNT (p~{$<~$}.05). LRT also had a 66\% larger absolute map size, although TMS intensity used for mapping was greater in LRT versus UNT (48\% vs. 26\% above active motor threshold) to achieve a target 20\% MEPmax at the hotspot, due to the lower slope of LRT. Map size was strongly correlated with the TMS intensity used for mapping (r~=~0.776, p~{$<~$}.001). Once map size was normalised to TMS intensity, there was no difference between the groups (p~=~.683). We conclude that LRT had a lower stimulus-response curve slope/excitability, suggesting higher neural efficiency. TMS map size was overwhelmingly determined by TMS intensity, even when the MEP response at the hotspot was matched among individuals, likely due to larger current spread with higher intensities. Motor representation appears similar between LRT and UNT given no difference in the normalised map size.},

The main aims of this narrative review are to describe the neuromuscular determinants of rate of force development and to discuss various methodological considerations inherent to its evaluation for research and clinical purposes. Rate of force development (1) seems to be mainly determined by the capacity to produce maximal voluntary activation in the early phase of an explosive contraction (first 50-75~ms), particularly as a result of increased motor unit discharge rate; (2) can be improved by both explosive-type and heavy-resistance strength training in different subject populations, mainly through an improvement in rapid muscle activation; (3) is quite difficult to evaluate in a valid and reliable way. Therefore, we provide evidence-based practical recommendations for rational quantification of rate of force development in both laboratory and clinical settings.},

Fifteen healthy males performed isometric grasping contractions at 15\% and 30\% of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) with or without an additional mental (i.e., arithmetic) task. Mental performance, force variability, fNIRS and subjective perception responses were measured in each condition. The performance of the mental task decreased significantly while the force variability increased significantly at 30\% MVC as compared to 15\% MVC, suggesting that performance of dual-task required more attentional resources. PFC activity increased significantly as the effort increased from 15\% to 30\% MVC (p{$<$}.001). Although a larger change in the deoxyhemoglobin was observed in dual-task conditions (p=.051), PFC activity did not change significantly as compared to the motor tasks alone.

Peak force (Fpeak), peak rate of force development (RFDpeak) and RFD at different time epochs (0-50, 50-100, 100-150, 150-200) were calculated from the force-time curve, as well as CMJ and SJ height and the center of mass displacement. RFDpeak, RFD at 0-50, 50-100 and 100-150 ms and Fpeak were similar between the CMJ and the SJ (p = 0.26 to 0.99). Furthermore, RFD0-50 ms was similar between the ILP, the CMJ, and the SJ (p = 0.99 to 0.57). Higher values were observed in the ILP compared with the CMJ and the SJ in RFD50-100 ms and RFD100-150 ms (p \&lt; 0.001) and these differences were maintained even when RFD was scaled to body mass. The higher RFD normalized to Fpeak was attained at the 50-100 ms time interval with no differences between the ILP, CMJ and SJ and between males and females. These results suggest that the ability to exert rapid force is similar between the CMJ and the SJ, irrespective of the type of muscle},

METHODS: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to infer corticospinal excitability (CSE), intracortical facilitation (ICF), short and long-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI and LICI) and silent period duration prior to and following each training session during a 2-week heavy-load strength-training period. RESULTS: Following 2-weeks of strength-training, increases in strength (15.5\%, P\,=\,0.01) were accompanied by an increase in CSE (44\%, P\,=\,0.006) and reductions in both silent period duration (14\%, P\,{$<$}\,0.0001) and SICI (35\%, P\,=\,0.0004). Early training sessions acutely increased CSE and ICF, and acutely reduced silent period duration and SICI. However, later training sessions failed to modulate SICI and ICF, with substantial adaptations occurring offline between training sessions. No acute or retained changes in LICI were observed. Co-contraction of antagonists reduced by 36\% following 2-weeks of strength-training. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these results indicate that corticospinal plasticity occurs within and between training sessions throughout a training period in distinct early and later stages that are modulated by separate mechanisms of plasticity. The development of strength is akin to the previously reported changes that occur following motor skill training.},

After assessment of 1 repetition maximum (1RM) during unilateral knee extensions with the dominant limb, each subject exercised at 50\%, 75\% and 100\% of 1 RM in random order on separate occasions. Simultaneous changes in Cbv, Cox, Mbv and Mox from the contralateral prefrontal lobe and the dominant limb were measured by near infrared spectroscopy. During all three contractions, Cbv and Cox increased while Mbv and Mox decreased until fatigue in both genders. There were no signs of levelling off or decline in Cbv and Cox during any of these contractions, implying that there was no reduction in cerebral neuronal activation. Conversely, there was a rapid decline in Mbv and Mox during the early stages of the contractions, with a plateau or slight increase towards the end. The respective delta values at 50\%, 75\% and 100\% of 1RM for Cbv (0{$\cdot$}088 versus 0{$\cdot$}062 versus 0{$\cdot$}070), Cox (0{$\cdot$}042 versus 0{$\cdot$}033 versus 0{$\cdot$}038), Mbv (-0{$\cdot$}225 versus -0{$\cdot$}198 versus -0{$\cdot$}196), and Mox (-0{$\cdot$}169 versus -0{$\cdot$}146 versus -0{$\cdot$}158) were not significantly different in the total group (N = 24). These findings suggest that fatigue during resistance exercise lasting up to 60 s is mediated peripherally because of reduced blood volume and oxygen availability and is independent of the type and intensity of muscle contraction and gender.},

  abstract = {Background:  Somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEP) represent a non-invasive tool to assess neural responses elicited by somatosensory stimuli acquired via electrophysiological recordings. To date, there is no comprehensive evaluation of SEPs for the diagnostic investigation of exercise-induced functional neuroplasticity. This systematic review aims at highlighting the potential of SEP measurements as a diagnostic tool to investigate exercise-induced functional neuroplasticity of the sensorimotor system by reviewing studies comparing SEP parameters between athletes and healthy controls who are not involved in organized sports as well as between athlete cohorts of different sport disciplines. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted across three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus) by two independent researchers. Three hundred and ninety-seven records were identified, of which 10 cross-sectional studies were considered eligible. Results: Differences in SEP amplitudes and latencies between athletes and healthy controls or between athletes of different cohorts as well as associations between SEP parameters and demographic/behavioral variables (years of training, hours of training per week \& reaction time) were observed in seven out of 10 included studies. In particular, several studies highlight differences in short- and long-latency SEP parameters, as well as high-frequency oscillations (HFO) when comparing athletes and healthy controls. Neuroplastic differences in athletes appear to be modality-specific as well as dependent on training regimens and sport-specific requirements. This is exemplified by differences in SEP parameters of various athlete populations after stimulation of their primarily trained limb. Conclusion: Taken together, the existing literature suggests that athletes show specific functional neuroplasticity in the somatosensory system. Therefore, this systematic review highlights the potential of SEP measurements as an easy-to-use and inexpensive diagnostic tool to investigate functional neuroplasticity in the sensorimotor system of athletes. However, there are limitations regarding the small sample sizes and inconsistent methodology of SEP measurements in the studies reviewed. Therefore, future intervention studies are needed to verify and extend the conclusions drawn here.},

Here, we investigated motor control between M. vastus medialis (VM), M. vastus lateralis (VL), and M. rectus femoris (RF) in 12 healthy male recreational athletes during SQBP with three load levels (50\%, 62.5\% \& 75\% of 3-repetition maximum) following a standardized strength training protocol (3 sets of 10 repetitions). To quantify differences in motor control mechanisms in both time and frequency domains, we analyzed (1) muscle covariation via correlation analyses, as well as (2) common neural input via intermuscular coherence (IMC) between RF, VM, and VL. Our results revealed significantly higher gamma IMC between VM-VL compared to RF-VL and RF-VM for both legs. Correlation analyses demonstrated significantly higher correlation coefficients during ascent periods compared to descent periods across all analyzed muscle pairs. However, no load-dependent modulation of motor control could be observed. Our study provides novel evidence that motor control during SQBP is characterized by differences in common input between biarticular and monoarticular muscles. Additionally, muscle activation patterns show higher similarity during ascent compared to descent periods. Future research should aim to validate and extend our observations as insights into the underlying control mechanisms offer the possibility for practical implications to optimize training concepts in elite sports and rehabilitation.},

Nine men involved in recreational resistance training participated in the investigation by completing a single testing session. Within this session subjects performed isometric squats either while standing directly on the force plate (stable condition, S) or while standing on inflatable balls placed on top of the force plate (unstable condition, U). Electromyography (EMG) was recorded during both conditions from the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), biceps femoris (BF), and medial gastrocnemius (G) muscles. Results indicated peak force (PF) and rate of force development (RFD) were significantly lower, 45.6\% and 40.5\% respectively, in the U vs. S condition (p {$<$} or = 0.05). Average integrated EMG values for the VL and VM were significantly higher in the S vs. U condition. VL and VM muscle activity was 37.3\% and 34.4\% less in U in comparison to S. No significant differences were observed in muscle activity of the BF or G between U and S. The primary finding in this investigation is that isometric squatting in an unstable condition significantly reduces peak force, rate of force development, and agonist muscle activity with no change in antagonist or synergist muscle activity. In terms of providing a stimulus for strength gain no discernable benefit of performing a resistance exercise in an unstable condition was observed in the current study.},

  abstract = {Skeletal muscle adaptations to exercise confer many of the health benefits of physical activity and occur partly through alterations in skeletal muscle gene expression. The exact mechanisms mediating altered skeletal muscle gene expression in response to exercise are unknown. However, in recent years, chromatin remodelling through epigenetic histone modifications has emerged as a key regulatory mechanism controlling gene expression in general. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of exercise on global histone modifications that mediate chromatin remodelling and transcriptional activation in human skeletal muscle in response to exercise. In addition, we sought to examine the signalling mechanisms regulating these processes. Following 60 min of cycling, global histone 3 acetylation at lysine 9 and 14, a modification associated with transcriptional initiation, was unchanged from basal levels, but was increased at lysine 36, a site associated with transcriptional elongation. We examined the regulation of the class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs), which are enzymes that suppress histone acetylation and have been implicated in the adaptations to exercise. While we found no evidence of proteasomal degradation of the class IIa HDACs, we found that HDAC4 and 5 were exported from the nucleus during exercise, thereby removing their transcriptional repressive function. We also observed activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the calcium\textendash calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in response to exercise, which are two kinases that induce phosphorylation-dependent class IIa HDAC nuclear export. These data delineate a signalling pathway that might mediate skeletal muscle adaptations in response to exercise.},

Twenty-three physically active men aged 23 {$\pm$} 3.9 years participated in the study. Subjects completed 3 unloaded CMJ and 3 unloaded SJ in random order on a force plate. The RFD was measured during CMJ and SJ movements with vertical jump displacement (VJD) measured simultaneously during the CMJ only. Subjects incorporated arm swing to their CMJ technique to reach up as high as possible, and VJD was measured. All SJ were executed with both hands on the hips throughout the full range of movement. Peak rate of force development (PRFD), peak force (PF), and time to peak force (TPF) were significantly correlated to VJD during the CMJ (r = 0.68, r = 0.51, and r = -0.48, respectively). The RFD and TPF during the CMJ and SJ were associated with low test-retest reliability (coefficient of variation [CV]: 11.8-7.9\%). Peak and average power, PF, and VJD produced high test-retest reliability (CV: 2.8-5.1\%) during both the CMJ and SJ movements. Our results indicate that PRFD, a measure of explosive strength, and PF, a measure of maximal strength, are the primary contributors to VJD during the CMJ in physically active men. However, caution must be used when interpreting data using PRFD because of its low retest reliability.},

In a field test with increments in running velocity a 2-min EEG was recorded, together with blood lactate concentration and heart rate, after each stage. An individual protocol was used, with up to six stages of running to ensure comparability of exercise intensity among the subjects, in each of 19 athletes (17 men, 2 women) experienced in leisure-time running. The exercise consisted initially of three running stages of aerobic exercise intensity without blood lactate accumulation followed by stages with an increase of lactate concentration. The protocol of the field test led to a progressive increase in cortical activity directly after the stages without blood lactate accumulation mainly in the {$\delta$} frequency band, followed by \texttheta{} and {$\alpha$}-1 frequency band, and less pronounced in the {$\alpha$}-2 and in the {$\beta$} frequency bands. After the stages with an onset and further increase of blood lactate accumulation significant decreases in the {$\beta$}-2, {$\beta$}-1 and {$\alpha$}-1 frequency bands occurred predominantly in temporal (T3, T4, T5, and T6) and occipital (O1, and O2) electrode positions, indicating a stage-by-stage decrease of activity. This decrease may be explained by feed-back from working muscle, via afferents to the cortex from intero- and proprio-receptors and affective processes. This could suggest that through a higher running intensity indicated by an onset of blood lactate accumulation metabolic and mechanical changes led to alterations within the afferent systems influencing the level of cortical activity.},

In this paper, a novel approach to address this issue is proposed. The method is based on the identification of single motor unit action potentials from the surface EMG signal with the use of the continuous wavelet transform. A manifestation variable is computed as the maximum of the outputs of a bank of matched filters at different scales. A threshold is applied to the manifestation variable to detect EMG activity. A model, based on the physical structure of the muscle, is used to test the proposed technique on synthetic signals with known features. The resultant bias of the onset estimate is lower than 40 ms and the standard deviation lower than 30 ms in case of additive colored Gaussian noise with signal-to-noise ratio as low as 2 dB. Comparison with previously developed methods was performed, and representative applications to experimental signals are presented. The method is designed for a complete real-time implementation and, thus, may be applied in clinical routine activity.},

One week before and immediately after the ultramarathon, maximal twitches were elicited from the relaxed KE and PF. Electrically evoked superimposed twitches of the KE were also elicited during maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) to determine maximal voluntary activation. MVC and maximal voluntary activation decreased significantly after the ultramarathon (-30.2 {$\pm$} 18.0\% and -27.7 {$\pm$} 13.0\%, respectively;P {$<$} 0.001). Surprisingly, peak twitch increased after the ultramarathon from 15.8 {$\pm$} 6.3 to 19.7 {$\pm$} 3.3 N {$\cdot$} m for PF (P {$<$} 0.01) and from 131.9 {$\pm$} 21.2 to 157.1 {$\pm$} 35.9 N for KE (P {$<$} 0.05). Also, shorter contraction and half-relaxation times were observed for both muscles. The compound muscle action potentials (M wave) were not significantly altered by the ultramarathon with the exception of the soleus, which showed a slightly higher M-wave amplitude after the running. From these results, it can be concluded that 65 km of running1) severely depressed the maximal voluntary force capacity mainly because of a decrease in maximal voluntary activation,2) potentiated the twitch mechanical response, and3) did not change significantly the M-wave characteristics.},

During the 2 days preceding a 30-km running race [duration 188.7 +/- 27.0 (SD) min] and immediately after the race, maximal percutaneous electrical stimulations (single twitch, 0.5-s tetanus at 20 and 80 Hz) were applied to the femoral nerve of 12 trained runners. Superimposed twitches were also delivered during isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) to determine the level of voluntary activation (\%VA). The vastus lateralis electromyogram was recorded. KE MVC decreased from pre- to postexercise (from 188.1 +/- 25.2 to 142.7 +/- 29.7 N x m; P {$<$} 0.001) as did \%VA (from 98.8 +/- 1.8 to 91.3 +/- 10.7\%; P {$<$} 0.05). The changes from pre- to postexercise in these two variables were highly correlated (R = 0.88; P {$<$} 0.001). The modifications in the mechanical response after the 80-Hz stimulation and M-wave peak-to-peak amplitude were also significant (P {$<$} 0.001 and P {$<$} 0.05, respectively). It can be concluded that 1) central fatigue, neuromuscular propagation, and muscular factors are involved in the 23.5 +/- 14.9\% reduction in MVC after a prolonged running bout at racing pace and 2) runners with the greatest KE strength loss experience large activation deficit.},

Within the weak to moderate force level, the normalized power in the alpha band in the contralateral sensorimotor areas was inversely linearly correlated with the force. Cortical-muscular coherence was observed in the beta band and its magnitude was not affected by the force. In contrast, during strong contractions, EEG power in the gamma band increased and was partly correlated with the Piper rhythm in the electromyogram. Our results show that the multiple oscillatory activities in the cortex are correlated with the force level in different ways. Cortical gamma band oscillation may reflect both focused attention and the efferent drive to the muscle during very strong tonic contraction.},

Subsequently, three independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts, followed by full-text reviews to assess the studies' eligibility. Results: Four studies met the inclusion criteria, data were extracted and methodological quality was assessed using the Downs and Black scale. Muscle oxygen saturation (\% SmO2) during reported muscle strength exercises showed a decreasing trend after a muscle strength protocol; that is, before the protocol (range = 68.07\textendash 77.9\%) and after (range = 9.50\textendash 46.09\%). Conclusions: The trend of the SmO2 variables is to decrease after a muscle strength protocol. Studies are lacking that allow expanding the use of these devices during this type of training.},

In the present study, to investigate mechanism(s) for such non-uniform muscle hypertrophy, we simultaneously measured neuromuscular activity and muscle oxygenation state at the middle and distal regions of VL during fatiguing heavy resistance exercise. Twelve males performed unilateral knee extension exercise which consisted of 4 sets of 8 repetitions at intensity of 80\% of the individual one repetition maximum. During the resistance exercise, neuromuscular activities and muscle oxygenation status at the middle and distal regions (50\% and 70\% of the thigh length, respectively) of VL were measured by using electromyography and near-infrared spectroscopy, respectively. Neuromuscular activities were similar between the distal and middle regions of VL, whereas muscle tissue oxygenation saturation was significantly lower at the distal than at the middle region of VL. These results suggest a possibility that the regional difference in muscle oxygenation but not in neuromuscular activity during fatiguing heavy resistance exercise is responsible for the regional difference in hypertrophy within a muscle.},

Thus, during both efforts, one's attention is focused on a certain feature of the body. Both meditation and exercise generally provide mental refreshment to humans. We hypothesized that the same brain regions are activated by both efforts in humans. To examine this hypothesis, we engaged participants in 3 tasks: meditation, exercise, and a control task. After each task, the participants underwent a 2-back test to concentrate their thoughts, while changes in their blood hemoglobin levels were simultaneously monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Seventeen participants (20\textendash 24 years of age; 11 men, 6 women) were enrolled. We applied a fast-Fourier transform (FFT) analysis to the NIRS wave data and calculated the correlation coefficients of the FFT data between (1) meditation and control, (2) exercise and control, and (3) meditation and exercise, at the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), brain areas that are generally involved in mental refreshment. A significant difference in the correlation coefficients between the OFC and DLPFC was detected in the meditation and exercise analysis, and signal source analysis confirmed that the NIRS waves spread from the right and left OFC edges (i.e., right and left temples) toward the center. Our results suggest that both meditation and exercise activate the OFC, which is involved in emotional reactions and motivation behavior, resulting in mental refreshment.},

  abstract = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a powerful tool for monitoring brain functional activities. Due to its non-invasive and non-restraining nature, fNIRS has found broad applications in brain functional studies. However, for fNIRS to work well, it is important to reduce its sensitivity to motion artifacts. We propose a new wavelet-based method for removing motion artifacts from fNIRS signals. The method relies on differences between artifacts and fNIRS signal in terms of duration and amplitude and is specifically designed for spike artifacts. We assume a gaussian distribution for the wavelet coefficients corresponding to the underlying hemodynamic signal in detail levels and identify the artifact coefficients using this distribution. An input parameter controls the intensity of artifact attenuation in trade-off with the level of distortion introduced in the signal. The method only modifies wavelet coefficients in levels adaptively selected based on the degree of contamination with motion artifact. To demonstrate the feasibility of the method, we tested it on experimental fNIRS data collected from three infant subjects. Normalized mean-square error and artifact energy attenuation were used as criteria for performance evaluation. The results show 18.29 and 16.42 dB attenuation in motion artifacts energy for 700 and 830 nm wavelength signals in a total of 29 motion events with no more than -16.7 dB distortion in terms of normalized mean-square error in the artifact-free regions of the signal.},

However, its promising applications are still underexplored. This study aims to test if the hysteresis area of the perceived exertion (RPE), heart rate (HR), and muscle oxyhaemoglobin concentration (muscle O2Hb) are sensitive to effort accumulation over multiple bouts of exercise. Ten physical education students performed five consecutive running bouts at maximal aerobic velocity. The consecutive bouts started when participants reported at least an RPE {$\leq$} 11 (Borg's 6-20 scale). The hysteresis areas of RPE, HR, and muscle O2Hb were calculated for each bout, and their magnitude was compared using Friedman ANOVA and Wilcoxon test. Effect sizes were calculated through Cohen's d. The hysteresis areas of all studied variables changed between the initial and final bouts: RPE and HR increased (between bouts 1-4: Z = -1.99, p = .04; Z = -2.19, p = .03, respectively), and muscle O2Hb decreased (between bouts 1-4: Z = -2.80, p {$<$} .01). Large effect sizes (d = 1.22 \textendash{} 1.81) were found in HR between bouts 1-4, 1-5, 2-4, 2-5, and muscle O2Hb between bouts 1-4 and 1-5. The results showed that the hysteresis areas of RPE, HR, and muscle O2Hb were sensitive to effort accumulation during repeated running exercises performed at maximal aerobic velocity. Despite further research is warranted, the hysteresis area of psychobiological variables points towards being a sensitive biomarker for monitoring acute fatigue.},

However, it is not known where a new skill is retained and processed before it is firmly consolidated. Some early aspects of motor skill acquisition involve the primary motor cortex (M1), but the nature of that involvement is unclear. We tested the possibility that the human M1 is essential to early motor consolidation. We monitored changes in elementary motor behaviour while subjects practised fast finger movements that rapidly improved in movement acceleration and muscle force generation. Here we show that low-frequency, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of M1 but not other brain areas specifically disrupted the retention of the behavioural improvement, but did not affect basal motor behaviour, task performance, motor learning by subsequent practice, or recall of the newly acquired motor skill. These findings indicate that the human M1 is specifically engaged during the early stage of motor consolidation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: After a stroke, 80\% of the chronic patients have difficulties to use their paretic upper limb (UL) in activities of daily life (ADL) even after rehabilitation. Virtual reality therapy (VRT) and anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are two innovative methods that have shown independently to positively impact functional recovery of the paretic UL when combined with conventional therapy. The objective of the project will be to evaluate the impact of adding anodal high-definition (HD)-tDCS during an intensive 3-week UL VRT and conventional therapy program on paretic UL function in chronic stroke. METHODS: The ReArm project is a quadruple-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled, bi-centre, two-arm parallel, and interventional study design. Fifty-eight chronic ({$>$} 3 months) stroke patients will be recruited from the Montpellier and Nimes University Hospitals. Patients will follow a standard 3-week in-patient rehabilitation program, which includes 13 days of VRT (Armeo Spring, 1 \texttimes{} 30 min session/day) and conventional therapy (3 \texttimes{} 30 min sessions/day). Twenty-nine patients will receive real stimulation (4x1 anodal HD-tDCS montage, 2 mA, 20 min) to the ipsilesional primary motor cortex during the VRT session and the other 29 patients will receive active sham stimulation (2 mA, 30 s). All outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, at the end of rehabilitation and again 3 months later. The primary outcome measure will be the wolf motor function test. Secondary outcomes will include measures of UL function (Box and Block Test), impairment (Fugl Meyer Upper Extremity), compensation (Proximal Arm Non-Use), ADL (Actimetry, Barthel Index). Other/exploratory outcomes will include pain, fatigue, effort and performance, kinematics, and motor cortical region activation during functional motor tasks. DISCUSSION: This will be the first trial to determine the impact of adding HD-tDCS during UL VRT and conventional therapy in chronic stroke patients. We hypothesize that improvements in UL function will be greater and longer-lasting with real stimulation than in those receiving sham.

Three-dimensional kinematic analysis provides quantitative and qualitative assessment of upper-limb motion and is used as an outcome measure to evaluate impaired movement after stroke. The number of kinematic variables used, however, is diverse, and models for upper-extremity motion analysis vary. Objective. The authors aim to identify a set of clinically useful and sensitive kinematic variables to quantify upper-extremity motor control during a purposeful daily activity, that is, drinking from a glass. Methods. For this purpose, 19 participants with chronic stroke and 19 healthy controls reached for a glass of water, took a sip, and placed it back on a table in a standardized way. An optoelectronic system captured 3-dimensional kinematics. Kinematical parameters describing movement time, velocity, strategy and smoothness, interjoint coordination, and compensatory movements were analyzed between groups. Results. The majority of kinematic variables showed significant differences between study groups. The number of movement units, total movement time, and peak angular velocity of elbow discriminated best between healthy participants and those with stroke as well as between those with moderate (Fugl-Meyer scores of 39-57) versus mild (Fugl-Meyer scores of 58-64) arm impairment. In addition, the measures of compensatory trunk and arm movements discriminated between those with moderate and mild stroke impairment. Conclusion. Kinematic analysis in this study identified a set of movement variables during a functional task that may serve as an objective assessment of upper-extremity motor performance in persons who can complete a task, such as reaching and drinking, after stroke.},

However, it is extremely difficult to apply general methods, which depend on the relative changes in the signal power or frequency characteristics of a surface EMG, during exercise. We define two qualitative factors of muscular and neural activity, and by compounding these factors, we define a fatigue coefficient to estimate muscular fatigue. These values can be calculated in real-time. The fatigue coefficient quantifies the influence of the muscular fatigue and is not affected by changes in the load amount. Therefore, it can be used to estimate muscular fatigue, even for non-repetitive actions and unknown load amounts.},

Twenty-five healthy, untrained subjects, 18-35 years old, were randomly assigned initial squatting positions of either self-selected neutral or 30 degrees of lower extremity turn-out from the self-selected neutral position. Surface electromyography and motion analysis data were collected simultaneously in 10 degrees intervals and analyzed from 10-60 degrees of knee flexion in both the ascending and descending phases of the squat. A four-way analysis of variance indicated that the main effect of lower extremity position and the interaction of extremity position and knee joint angles were not found to cause significant changes in muscle activity patterns. Significant changes in muscle activity did occur with changes in knee flexion angles in the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis but not in the semimembranosus/semitendinosus or biceps femoris.},

  abstract = {A central debate in the exercise sciences is the cause of the fatigue that develops especially during high intensity exercise of short duration. The most popular theory holds that this form of exercise is limited by a peripherally based, metabolite induced failure of skeletal muscle contractile function, independent of reduced muscle activation by the central nervous system; so-called peripheral fatigue. This theory arose originally from studies undertaken by Nobel Laureate Sir Archibald Vivian Hill and colleagues in Manchester, UK in the 1920s. In turn, their interpretations were crucially influenced by the earlier 1907 findings of Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins, Nobel Laureate for his discovery of the vitamins, and Walter Morley Fletcher. The original model of Hill and his colleagues proposed that performance during exercise of high intensity was limited by skeletal muscle anaerobiosis that developed as the result of a limiting skeletal muscle blood flow, following the onset of myocardial ischaemia. Such skeletal muscle anaerobiosis ultimately prevented the neutralization of the lactic acid that, Hill believed, initiated muscle contraction. The resulting lactic acid accumulation impaired skeletal muscle relaxation, causing the (involuntary) termination of exercise. The evolutionary progression of this model led to the ``catastrophe theory'' of Richard Edwards, which posits that exercise terminates when the physiological and biochemical limits of the body are exceeded, causing a catastrophic failure of intracellular homeostasis. This paper addresses six hallmark physiological requirements that must be correct if Hill's cardiovascular/ anaerobic/catastrophic model is the exclusive explanation for the fatigue that develops during maximum exercise to exhaustion. This leads to a review of the evidence supporting other, related ``catastrophe'' models that have been developed to explain fatigue during exercise of lower intensities and longer durations. It is concluded that there is little published evidence supporting the theory that fatigue occurs only after physiological homeostasis fails according to the prediction of these catastrophe models. Rather, it is proposed that fatigue in any form of exercise may form part of a regulated, anticipatory response co-ordinated in the subconscious brain. The ultimate goal of this regulation is to preserve homeostasis in all physiological systems during exercise, regardless of intensity or duration or the environmental conditions in which it is undertaken.},

To maximise practicality and minimise cost a single-sensor system is most desirable. This study sought to investigate whether a single lumbar-worn IMU is capable of identifying seven commonly observed squatting deviations. Twenty-two volunteers (18 males, 4 females, age: 26.09{$\pm$}3.98 years, height: 1.75{$\pm$}0.14m, body mass: 75.2{$\pm$}14.2 kg) performed the squat exercise correctly and with 7 induced deviations. IMU signal features were extracted for each condition. Statistical analysis and leave one subject out classifier evaluation were used to assess the ability of a single sensor to evaluate performance. Binary level classification was able to distinguish between correct and incorrect squatting performance with a sensitivity of 64.41\%, specificity of 88.01\% and accuracy of 80.45\%. Multi-label classification was able to distinguish between specific squat deviations with a sensitivity of 59.65\%, specificity of 94.84\% and accuracy of 56.55\%. These results indicate that a single IMU can successfully discriminate between squatting deviations. A larger data set must be collected and more complex classification techniques developed in order to create a more robust exercise analysis IMU-based system.},

  abstract = {Spontaneous social coordination has been extensively described in natural settings but so far no controlled methodological approaches have been employed that systematically advance investigations into the possible self-organized nature of bond formation and dissolution between humans. We hypothesized that, under certain contexts, spontaneous synchrony\textemdash a well-described phenomenon in biological and physical settings\textemdash could emerge spontaneously between humans as a result of information exchange. Here, a new way to quantify interpersonal interactions in real time is proposed. In a simple experimental paradigm, pairs of participants facing each other were required to actively produce actions, while provided (or not) with the vision of similar actions being performed by someone else. New indices of interpersonal coordination, inspired by the theoretical framework of coordination dynamics (based on relative phase and frequency overlap between movements of individuals forming a pair) were developed and used. Results revealed that spontaneous phase synchrony (i.e., unintentional in-phase coordinated behavior) between two people emerges as soon as they exchange visual information, even if they are not explicitly instructed to coordinate with each other. Using the same tools, we also quantified the degree to which the behavior of each individual remained influenced by the social encounter even after information exchange had been removed, apparently a kind of social memory.},

Methods: Twenty-two trained men (25.2{$\pm$}4.1 years, 182.1{$\pm$}12.3 cm and 91.2{$\pm$}5.9 kg) performed the following four training protocols with 10-repetition maximum loads in random order: 1) traditional set (TS): three sets were performed in succession for the barbell bench press (BP), lat pulldown (LPD), 45\textdegree{} incline bench press (BP45), seated close-grip row (SCR), triceps extension (TE) and biceps curl (BC) on a pulley; 2) paired set (PS): three paired sets were performed as follows: BP-LPD, BP45-SCR, and TC-B; 3) super-set (SS): similar to the PS protocol, but without rest between paired exercises; 4) circuit training (CT): one set of each exercise was performed sequentially three times. Results: The results showed greater total volume under the SS (8063.2{$\pm$}2270.5 kg) protocol versus the TS (7356.8{$\pm$}2279.7 kg). Total work (repetitions) was also significantly greater for the SS and CT protocols versus the TS (P{$<$}0.05). Conclusions: Therefore, the practitioners should consider utilizing the SS method during time-constrained periods with the goal to achieve greater training volume in time-efficient manner versus the TS, PS and CT methods.},

The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of chronic resistance training on corticospinal excitability (CE) of the biceps brachii during elbow flexion contractions at various intensities and the CNS site (i.e. supraspinal or spinal) predominantly responsible for any training-induced differences in CE. Fifteen male subjects were divided into two groups: 1) chronic resistance-trained (RT), (n = 8) and 2) non-RT, (n = 7). Each group performed four sets of {$\sim$}5 s elbow flexion contractions of the dominant arm at 10 target forces (from 10\%\textendash 100\% MVC). During each contraction, subjects received 1) transcranial magnetic stimulation, 2) transmastoid electrical stimulation and 3) brachial plexus electrical stimulation, to determine MEP, CMEP and compound muscle action potential (Mmax) amplitudes, respectively, of the biceps brachii. All MEP and CMEP amplitudes were normalized to Mmax. MEP amplitudes were similar in both groups up to 50\% MVC, however, beyond 50\% MVC, MEP amplitudes were lower in the chronic RT group (p{$<$}0.05). CMEP amplitudes recorded from 10\textendash 100\% MVC were similar for both groups. The ratio of MEP amplitude/absolute force and CMEP amplitude/absolute force were reduced (p{$<$}0.012) at all contraction intensities from 10\textendash 100\% MVC in the chronic-RT compared to the non-RT group. In conclusion, chronic resistance training alters supraspinal and spinal excitability. However, adaptations in the spinal cord (i.e. motoneurone) seem to have a greater influence on the altered CE.},

  abstract = {Resistance training enhances muscular force due to a combination of neural plasticity and muscle hypertrophy. It has been well documented that the increase in strength over the first few weeks of resistance training (i.e. acute) has a strong underlying neural component and further enhancement in strength with long-term (i.e. chronic) resistance training is due to muscle hypertrophy. For obvious reasons, collecting long-term data on how chronic-resistance training affects the nervous system not feasible. As a result, the effect of chronic-resistance training on neural plasticity is less understood and has not received systematic exploration. Thus, the aim of this review is to provide rationale for investigating neural plasticity beyond acute-resistance training. We use cross-sectional work to highlight neural plasticity that occurs with chronic-resistance training at sites from the brain to spinal cord. Specifically, intra-cortical circuitry and the spinal motoneuron seem to be key sites for this plasticity. We then urge the need to further investigate the differential effects of acute versus chronic-resistance training on neural plasticity, and the role of this plasticity in increased strength. Such investigations may help in providing a clearer definition of the continuum of acute and chronic-resistance training, how the nervous system is altered during this continuum and the causative role of neural plasticity in changes in strength over the continuum of resistance training.},

  abstract = {There is growing interest in resistance training, but many aspects related to this type of exercise are still not fully understood. Performance varies substantially depending on how resistance training variables are manipulated. Fatigue is a complex phenomenon usually attributed to central (neuronal) and/or peripheral (muscular) origin. Cerebral oxygenation may be associated with the decision to stop exercise, and muscle oxygenation may be related to resistance training responses. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive optical technique used to monitor cerebral and muscle oxygenation levels. The purpose of this review is to briefly describe the NIRS technique, validation and reliability, and its application in resistance exercise. NIRS-measured oxygenation in cerebral tissue has been validated against magnetic resonance imaging during motor tasks. In muscle tissue, NIRS-measured oxygenation was shown to be highly related to venous oxygen saturation and muscle oxidative rate was closely related to phosphocreatine resynthesis, measured by 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy after exercise. The test-retest reliability of cerebral and muscle NIRS measurements have been established under a variety of experimental conditions, including static and dynamic exercise. Although NIRS has been used extensively to evaluate muscle oxygenation levels during aerobic exercise, only four studies have used this technique to examine these changes during typical resistance training exercises. Muscle oxygenation was influenced by different resistance exercise protocols depending on the load or duration of exercise, the number of sets and the muscle being monitored. NIRS is a promising, non-invasive technique that can be used to evaluate cerebral and muscle oxygenation levels simultaneously during exercise, thereby improving our understanding of the mechanisms influencing performance and fatigue.},

Both groups used the same exercises, relative intensity and repetition volume, only differing in the velocity loss threshold of each set (VL10: 10\% vs. VL20: 20\%). Pre- and post-training assessments included an incremental loading test and a 15-m linear sprint to assess the force- and load-velocity relationships and athletic performance variables, respectively. No significant between-group differences (P {$>$} 0.05) were observed for the force-velocity relationship parameters (ES range = 0.15\textendash 0.42), the MPV attained against different external loads (ES range = 0.02\textendash 0.18) or the 15-m sprint time (ES = 0.09). A high between-participants variability was reported for the number of repetitions completed in each training set (CV = 30.3\% for VL10 and 29.4\% for VL20). These results suggest that both velocity loss thresholds induce similar changes on the lower-body function. The high and variable number of repetitions completed may compromise the velocity-based approach for prescribing and monitoring the repetition volume during a power-oriented resistance training program conducted with the countermovement jump exercise.},

The system uses a hierarchical algorithm, consisting of two layers of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), to first recognize the type of exercise being performed, followed by recognition of exercise intensity. The first layer uses a single SVM to recognize the type of the performed exercise. Based on the recognized type a corresponding intensity prediction SVM is selected on the second layer, specializing in intensity prediction for the recognized type of exercise. We evaluate the system for a set of upper-body exercises using different weight loads. Additionally, we compare the most important features for exercise and intensity recognition tasks and investigate how different sliding window combinations, sensor configurations and number of training subjects impact the algorithm performance. We perform all of the experiments for two different types of features to evaluate the feasibility of implementation on resource constrained hardware. The results show the algorithm is able to recognize exercise types with approximately 85\% accuracy and 6\% intensity prediction error. Furthermore, due to similar performance using different types of features, the algorithm offers potential for implementation on resource constrained hardware.},

Due to its properties, the near-infrared light can penetrate biological tissue reasonably well to assess brain activity and two types of measurements are possible according to the number of channels used: dynamic changes in a localized brain region or functional brain imaging. The theoretical and technological advances of the past 10\textendash 15 years have opened the door to a range of applications in the human movement sciences, including some that involve imaging of the adult brain during motor and cognitive tasks, which for many years had been inaccessible to NIRS. This article examines the perturbation methods for measuring cerebral haemodynamic responses within resting and exercise conditions in humans and how NIRS can be used to image the moving brain. Methodological challenges of NIRS technique are presented, while the advantages and pitfalls of NIRS compared to other neuroimaging methods are discussed. Actual and future uses for NIRS in the field of sport sciences are outlined for a better understanding of brain processes during movement.},

  abstract = {Understanding the interactions between brain activity and behavior comprehensively in achieving optimal exercise performance in sports is still lacking. The existent research in this area has been limited by the constraints of sports environments and the robustness of the most suitable non-invasive functional neuroimaging methods (electroencephalography, EEG and functional near-infrared spectroscopy, fNIRS) to motion artifacts and noise. However, recent advances in brain mapping technology should improve the capabilities of the future brain imaging devices to assess and monitor the level of adaptive cognitive-motor performance during exercise in sports environments. The purpose of this position manuscript is to discuss the contributions and issues in behavioral neuroscience related to brain activity measured during exercise and in various sports. A first part aims to give an overview of EEG and fNIRS neuroimaging methods assessing electrophysiological activity and hemodynamic responses of the acute and chronic relation of physical exercise on the human brain. Then, methodological issues, such as the reliability of brain data during physical exertion, key limitations and possible prospects of fNIRS and EEG methods are provided. While the use of such methods in sports environments remains scarce and limited to controlled cycling task, new generation of wearable, whole-scalp EEG and fNIRS technologies could open up a range of new applications in sports sciences for providing neuroimaging-based biomarkers (hemodynamic and/or neural electrical signals) to various types of exercise and innovative training.},

  abstract = {Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a versatile neuroimaging tool with an increasing acceptance in the neuroimaging community. While often lauded for its portability, most of the fNIRS setups employed in neuroscientific research still impose usage in a laboratory environment. We present a wearable, multi-channel fNIRS imaging system for functional brain imaging in unrestrained settings. The system operates without optical fiber bundles, using eight dual wavelength light emitting diodes and eight electro-optical sensors, which can be placed freely on the subject's head for direct illumination and detection. Its performance is tested on N=8 subjects in a motor execution paradigm performed under three different exercising conditions: (i) during outdoor bicycle riding, (ii) while pedaling on a stationary training bicycle, and (iii) sitting still on the training bicycle. Following left hand gripping, we observe a significant decrease in the deoxyhemoglobin concentration over the contralateral motor cortex in all three conditions. A significant task-related {$\Delta$}HbO2 increase was seen for the non-pedaling condition. Although the gross movements involved in pedaling and steering a bike induced more motion artifacts than carrying out the same task while sitting still, we found no significant differences in the shape or amplitude of the HbR time courses for outdoor or indoor cycling and sitting still. We demonstrate the general feasibility of using wearable multi-channel NIRS during strenuous exercise in natural, unrestrained settings and discuss the origins and effects of data artifacts. We provide quantitative guidelines for taking condition-dependent signal quality into account to allow the comparison of data across various levels of physical exercise. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of functional NIRS brain imaging during an outdoor activity in a real life situation in humans.},

  abstract = {Most approaches to musical rhythm, whether in music theory, music psychology, or musical neuroscience, presume that musical rhythms are based on isochronous (temporally equidistant) beats and/or beat subdivisions. However, rhythms that are based on non-isochronous, or unequal patterns of time are prominent in the music of Southeast Europe, the Near East and Southern Asia, and in the music of Africa and the African diaspora. The present study examines one such style found in contemporary Malian jembe percussion music. A corpus of 15 representative performances of three different pieces (``Manjanin,'' ``Maraka,'' and ``Woloso'') containing \textasciitilde 43,000 data points was analyzed. Manjanin and Woloso are characterized by non-isochronous beat subdivisions (a short IOI followed by two longer IOIs), while Maraka subdivisions are quasi-isochronous. Analyses of onsets and asynchronies show no significant differences in timing precision and coordination between the isochronously timed Maraka vs. the non-isochronously timed Woloso performances, though both pieces were slightly less variable than non-isochronous Manjanin. Thus, the precision and stability of rhythm and entrainment in human music does not necessarily depend on metric isochrony, consistent with the hypothesis that isochrony is not a biologically-based constraint on human rhythmic behavior. Rather, it may represent a historically popular option within a variety of culturally contingent options for metric organization.},

  abstract = {Acquisition of a new skill is generally associated with a decrease in the need for effortful control over performance, leading to the development of automaticity. Automaticity by definition has been achieved when performance of a primary task is minimally affected by other ongoing tasks. The neural basis of automaticity was examined by testing subjects in a serial reaction time (SRT) task under both single-task and dual-task conditions. The diminishing cost of dual-task performance was used as an index for automaticity. Subjects performed the SRT task during two functional magnetic imaging sessions separated by 3 h of behavioral training over multiple days. Behavioral data showed that, by the end of testing, subjects had automated performance of the SRT task. Before behavioral training, performance of the SRT task concurrently with the secondary task elicited activation in a wide network of frontal and striatal regions, as well as parietal lobe. After extensive behavioral training, dual-task performance showed comparatively less activity in bilateral ventral premotor regions, right middle frontal gyrus, and right caudate body; activity in other prefrontal and striatal regions decreased equally for single-task and dual-task conditions. These data suggest that lateral and dorsolateral prefrontal regions, and their corresponding striatal targets, subserve the executive processes involved in novice dual-task performance. The results also showed that supplementary motor area and putamen/globus pallidus regions showed training-related decreases for sequence conditions but not for random conditions, confirming the role of these regions in the representation of learned motor sequences.},

Since planning and control of movements is closely related to sensorimotor synchronization, the investigation of synchronization abilities may allow insights into fundamental principles of motor behaviour. The finger-tapping task has frequently been used to study the synchronization of one's own movements in relation to external events. Data from behavioural studies gave rise to the assumption that it is not the peripheral event (i.e., finger-tap or pacing signal) that is synchronized but its central representation. The neural foundations of sensorimotor synchronization have only recently been investigated and are still poorly understood. The present article reviews data from neurophysiological studies investigating sensorimotor synchronization to shed light on the neurophysiological processes associated with sensorimotor synchronization. This review focuses on studies investigating neuroelectric and neuromagnetic activity associated with simple repetitive synchronization tasks.},

  abstract = {Position-estimation systems for indoor localization play an important role in everyday life. The global positioning system (GPS) is a popular positioning system, which is mainly efficient for outdoor environments. In indoor scenarios, GPS signal reception is weak. Therefore, achieving good position estimation accuracy is a challenge. To overcome this challenge, it is necessary to utilize other position-estimation systems for indoor localization. However, other existing indoor localization systems, especially based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor data, still face challenges such as accumulated errors from sensors and external magnetic field effects. This paper proposes a position-estimation algorithm that uses the combined features of the accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope data from an IMU sensor for position estimation. In this paper, we first estimate the pitch and roll values based on a fusion of accelerometer and gyroscope sensor values. The estimated pitch values are used for step detection. The step lengths are estimated by using the pitching amplitude. The heading of the pedestrian is estimated by the fusion of magnetometer and gyroscope sensor values. Finally, the position is estimated based on the step length and heading information. The proposed pitch-based step detection algorithm achieves 2.5\% error as compared with acceleration-based step detection approaches. The heading estimation proposed in this paper achieves a mean heading error of 4.72\textdegree{} as compared with the azimuth- and magnetometer-based approaches. The experimental results show that the proposed position-estimation algorithm achieves a high position accuracy that significantly outperforms that of conventional estimation methods used for validation in this paper.},

  abstract = {While in young adults (YAs) the underlying neural mechanisms of motor learning are well-studied, studies on the involvement of the somatosensory system during motor skill learning in older adults (OAs) remain sparse. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate motor learning-induced neuroplasticity in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in YAs and OAs. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were used to quantify somatosensory activation prior and immediately after motor skill learning in 20 right-handed healthy YAs (age range: 19\textendash 35 years) and OAs (age range: 57\textendash 76 years). Participants underwent a single session of a 30-min co-contraction task of the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and deltoid muscle. To assess the effect of motor learning, muscle onset asynchrony (MOA) between the onsets of the contractions of both muscles was measured using electromyography monitoring. In both groups, MOA shortened significantly during motor learning, with YAs showing bigger reductions. No changes were found in SEP amplitudes after motor learning in both groups. However, a correlation analysis revealed an association between baseline SEP amplitudes of the N20/P25 and N30 SEP component and the motor learning slope in YAs such that higher amplitudes are related to higher learning. Hence, the present findings suggest that SEP amplitudes might serve as a predictor of individual motor learning success, at least in YAs. Additionally, our results suggest that OAs are still capable of learning complex motor tasks, showing the importance of motor training in higher age to remain an active part of our society as a prevention for care dependency.},

Despite the availability of several factorisation methods in the literature, the most appropriate method for muscle synergy extraction is currently unknown. In this study, we compared four muscle synergy extraction methods: non-negative matrix factorisation, principal component analysis, independent component analysis, and factor analysis. Probability distribution of muscle activation patterns were compared with the probability distribution of synergy excitation primitives obtained from the four factorisation methods. Muscle synergies extracted using non-negative matrix factorisation best matched the probability distribution of muscle activation patterns across different walking and running speeds. Non-negative matrix factorisation also best tracked changes in muscle activation patterns compared to the other factorisation methods. Our results suggest that non-negative matrix factorisation is the best factorisation method for identifying muscle synergies in dynamic tasks with different levels of muscle contraction.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to describe the force/velocity and power/velocity relationships obtained during squat exercise. The maximal force (F0) was extrapolated from the force/velocity relationship and compared to the isometric force directly measured with the aid of a force platform placed under the subject's feet. Fifteen international downhill skiers [mean (SD) age 22.4 (2.6)\,years, height 178 (6.34)\,cm and body mass 81.3 (7.70)\,kg] performed maximal dynamic and isometric squat exercises on a guided barbell. The dynamic squats were performed with masses ranging from 60 to 180\,kg, which were placed on the shoulders. The force produced during the squat exercise was linearly related to the velocity in each subject (r2=0.83\textendash 0.98, P\,{$<$}\,0.05\textendash 0.0001). The extrapolated F0 was 23\% higher than the measured isometric force (P\,{$<$}\,0.001), and the two measurements were not correlated. This may be attributed to the position of the subject, since the isometric force was obtained at a constant angle (90\textdegree{} of knee flexion), whereas the dynamic forces were measured through a range of movements (from 90\textdegree{} to 180\textdegree ). The power/velocity relationship was parabolic in shape for each subject (r2=0.94\textendash 0.99, P\,{$<$} 0.01\textendash 0.0001). However, the curve obtained exhibited only an ascending part. The highest power was produced against the lightest load (i.e., 60\,kg). The maximal power (W\textperiodcentered max) and optimal velocity were never reached. The failure to observe the descending part of the power/velocity curve may be attributed to the upper limitation of the velocities studied. Nevertheless, the extrapolation of W\textperiodcentered maxfrom the power/velocity equation showed that it would be reached for a load close to body mass, or even under unloaded conditions.},

PVBT performed a 4-week strength block (e.g., 0.55\textendash 0.70 m{$\cdot$}s-1) followed by a 3-week power block (e.g., 0.85\textendash 1.0 m{$\cdot$}s-1), whereas OTL performed training at \textasciitilde 0.85\textendash 0.9 m{$\cdot$}s-1. 1RM and peak power output (PP) assessments on the back squat (BS), bench press (BP) and deadlift (DL) exercises were assessed pre and post training.

  abstract = {1. Efficient local excitation of nerve-trunk or muscle elicits contractions quite as strong as the most vigorous voluntary effort; this is in opposition to the results of Mosso, FICK, and others. 2. In prolonged quiescent isch\ae mia there is evidence of failure of conduction of impulses from nerve to muscle before the muscle itself has lost contractility. 3. There is no proof of early failure of propagation of the impulse from nerve to muscle in the process of fatigue by serial induced shocks in man and animals with the circulation intact, and under isch\ae mic conditions in animals stimulation through the nerve-trunk by serial induced shocks can exhaust almost completely the contractile power of the muscle, without any failure at the myo-neural junction showing itself. But continued faradisation of the nerve-trunk, with and without an active circulation, affords evidence (in animal experiments) of such failure prior to complete exhaustion of the muscle. Such failure in the field of conjunction does not explain the primarily ``central'', nature of voluntary fatigue, since in the latter condition faradisation of the nerve-trunk still causes muscular contraction, showing absence of ``myo-neural'' block; this also applies to fatigue during isch\ae mia. 4. The evidence available does not indicate rise in the threshold value of the stimulus for the peripheral neuro-muscular mechanism as an important factor in voluntary fatigue. 5. While voluntary fatigue is primarily central in its incidence, there may or may not be an overlapping effect in the way of failure in the contractility of the muscle itself; this varies according as relatively quick or slow series of voluntary efforts are used to induce fatigue. In addition, the diminution of contractility for a quick series is shown by a comparison (a) of the amount of work elicited by peripheral stimulation for a given period of time after voluntary fatigue from quick and slow series with (b) the amount for a similar period of time from the unfatigued muscle. With a slow series there is little evidence of reduction of contractile power. 6. After the induction of voluntary fatigue, equal periods of rest and of peripheral stimulation show striking differences as regards recovery in the power and number of the voluntary contractions, before fatigue again ensues, the recovery after the latter being comparatively insignificant as compared with the recovery after the former. This points to the influence of local conditions arising in the muscle, having an inhibiting influence probably through afferent nervous impulses on the central nervous system\textemdash since the failure of response to voluntary effort is not adequately accounted for by changes in peripheral excitability or in muscular contractility. 7. Recovery after voluntary fatigue is better if the load is removed from the muscle than if the muscle is left loaded or kept in static contraction. 8. Isch\ae awmia per se does not markedly affect the contractile response to a voluntary effort for about 15 minutes. After this a pronounced weakening develops, and peripheral stimulation then causes contraction that is less weakened than the response to voluntary effort; the nerve-trunk becomes less effective than the muscle excited directly\textemdash an indication of ``myo-neural'' depression. 9. In a limb artificially rendered isch\ae mic, voluntary muscular fatigue from serial contractions is also largely in the central nervous system, but is much earlier in occurrence than when the circulation is intact, e.g. 2 to 3 minutes as compared with 15 to 20 minutes (weight 2 kilos: rate 30 per minute). This earlier central failure is attributable to the influence of afferent inhibitory impulses from the working muscle. 10. The fatigue of static voluntary contraction seems to be essentially central in origin. It differs markedly from fatigue induced by a series of voluntary efforts in regard to the effects of (a) rest, (b) peripheral stimulation, and (c) isch\ae mia, equal periods of rest and peripheral stimulation by a faradic current showing similar behaviour as regards recovery in static fatigue. 11. The fatigue records of static voluntary contraction from muscle (a) with the circulation intact and (b) during isch\ae mia are apparently identical if the fatigue in both is complete in about 3 to 5 minutes. As the contractile powers of the muscle are not similar at this point when tested by serial peripheral stimulation, fatigue in short isch\ae mic static voluntary efforts is also central. In efforts lasting longer than about 5 minutes, the isch\ae mic static contraction approaches at this point the base-line more rapidly than does the contraction with the circulation intact. The more rapid decline appears to be contingent on the presence of afferent impulses, since the contractility of the muscle is not exhausted. 12. A ``staircase'' of contractions may be elicited under intact circulatory and under isch\ae mic conditions; the phenomena are probably not due to variations in the H ion concentration. 13. In view of the evidence submitted as to the importance of afferent nervous impulses in the processes of voluntary fatigue for local muscular actions under normal and isch\ae mic conditions, it is probable that afferent nervous impulses of similar origin tend to limit the muscular response in more widespread voluntary efforts, in addition to factors involving (a) the contractility of the muscles themselves, (b) the central nervous system directly. I have to record my indebtedness to Professor MacWilliam for much valued advice in this investigation. Part of the expenses connected with the research was defrayed by a grant from the Carnegie Trust for the Scottish Universities.},

In the laboratory, it is most often studied in the form of finger tapping to a sequence of auditory stimuli. This review summarizes theories and empirical findings obtained with the tapping task. Its eight sections deal with the role of intention, rate limits, the negative mean asynchrony, variability, models of error correction, perturbation studies, neural correlates of SMS, and SMS in musical contexts. The central theoretical issue is considered to be how best to characterize the perceptual information and the internal processes that enable people to achieve and maintain SMS. Recent research suggests that SMS is controlled jointly by two error correction processes (phase correction and period correction) that differ in their degrees of cognitive control and may be associated with different brain circuits. They exemplify the general distinction between subconscious mechanisms of action regulation and conscious processes involved in perceptual judgment and action planning.},

  abstract = {Skeletal muscle activity is continuously modulated across physiologic states to provide coordination, flexibility and responsiveness to body tasks and external inputs. Despite the central role the muscular system plays in facilitating vital body functions, the network of brain-muscle interactions required to control hundreds of muscles and synchronize their activation in relation to distinct physiologic states has not been investigated. Recent approaches have focused on general associations between individual brain rhythms and muscle activation during movement tasks. However, the specific forms of coupling, the functional network of cortico-muscular coordination, and how network structure and dynamics are modulated by autonomic regulation across physiologic states remains unknown. To identify and quantify the cortico-muscular interaction network and uncover basic features of neuro-autonomic control of muscle function, we investigate the coupling between synchronous bursts in cortical rhythms and peripheral muscle activation during sleep and wake. Utilizing the concept of time delay stability and a novel network physiology approach, we find that the brain-muscle network exhibits complex dynamic patterns of communication involving multiple brain rhythms across cortical locations and different electromyographic frequency bands. Moreover, our results show that during each physiologic state the cortico-muscular network is characterized by a specific profile of network links strength, where particular brain rhythms play role of main mediators of interaction and control. Further, we discover a hierarchical reorganization in network structure across physiologic states, with high connectivity and network link strength during wake, intermediate during REM and light sleep, and low during deep sleep, a sleep-stage stratification that demonstrates a unique association between physiologic states and cortico-muscular network structure. The reported empirical observations are consistent across individual subjects, indicating universal behavior in network structure and dynamics, and high sensitivity of cortico-muscular control to changes in autonomic regulation, even at low levels of physical activity and muscle tone during sleep. Our findings demonstrate previously unrecognized basic principles of brain-muscle network communication and control, and provide new perspectives on the regulatory mechanisms of brain dynamics and locomotor activation, with potential clinical implications for neurodegenerative, movement and sleep disorders, and for developing efficient treatment strategies.},

The assessment of RFD has been used for strength diagnosis, to monitor the effects of training interventions in both healthy populations and patients, discriminate high-level athletes from those of lower levels, evaluate the impairment in mechanical muscle function after acute bouts of eccentric muscle actions and estimate the degree of fatigue and recovery after acute exhausting exercise. Notably, the evaluation of RFD in human skeletal muscle is a complex task as influenced by numerous distinct methodological factors including mode of contraction, type of instruction, method used to quantify RFD, devices used for force/torque recording and ambient temperature. Another important aspect is our limited understanding of the mechanisms underpinning rapid muscle force production. Therefore, this review is primarily focused on (i) describing the main mechanical characteristics of RFD; (ii) analysing various physiological factors that influence RFD; and (iii) presenting and discussing central biomechanical and methodological factors affecting the measurement of RFD. The intention of this review is to provide more methodological and analytical coherency on the RFD concept, which may aid to clarify the thinking of coaches and sports scientists in this area.},

Relationship between velocity loss and repetitions in reserve in the bench press and back squat exercises. J Strength Cond Res 34(9): 2537-2547, 2020-This study aimed to compare the pattern of repetition velocity decline during a single set to failure performed against 4 relative loads in the bench press (BP) and full back squat (SQ) exercises. After an initial test to determine 1 repetition maximum (1RM) strength and load-velocity relationships, 20 men performed one set of repetitions to failure (MNR test) against loads of 50, 60, 70, and 80\% 1RM in BP and SQ, on 8 random order sessions performed every 6-7 days. Velocity against the load that elicited a {$\sim$}1.00 m{$\cdot$}s (V1 m{$\cdot$}s load) was measured before and immediately after each MNR test, and it was considered a measure of acute muscle fatigue. The number of repetitions completed against each relative load showed high interindividual variability in both BP (coefficient of variation [CV]: 15-22\%) and SQ (CV: 26-34\%). Strong relationships were found between the relative loss of velocity in the set and the percentage of performed repetitions in both exercises (R = 0.97 and 0.93 for BP and SQ, respectively). Equations to predict repetitions left in reserve from velocity loss are provided. For a given magnitude of velocity loss within the set (15-65\%), the percentages of performed repetitions were lower for the BP compared with the SQ for all loads analyzed. Acute fatigue after each set to failure was found dependent on the magnitude of velocity loss (r = 0.97 and 0.99 for BP and SQ, respectively) but independent of the number of repetitions completed by each participant (p {$>$} 0.05) for both exercises. The percentage of velocity loss against the V1 m{$\cdot$}s load decreased as relative load increased, being greater for BP than SQ. These findings indicate that monitoring repetition velocity can be used to provide a very good estimate of the number (or percentage) of repetitions actually performed and those left in reserve in each exercise set, and thus to more objectively quantify the level of effort incurred during resistance training.},

  abstract = {Dancing and playing music require people to coordinate actions with auditory rhythms. In laboratory perception-action coordination tasks, people are asked to synchronize taps with a metronome. When synchronizing with a metronome, people tend to anticipate stimulus onsets, tapping slightly before the stimulus. The anticipation tendency increases with longer stimulus periods of up to 3500ms, but is less pronounced in trained individuals like musicians compared to non-musicians. Furthermore, external factors influence the timing of tapping. These factors include the presence of auditory feedback from one's own taps, the presence of a partner performing coordinated joint tapping, and transmission latencies (TLs) between coordinating partners. Phenomena like the anticipation tendency can be explained by delay-coupled systems, which may be inherent to the sensorimotor system during perception-action coordination. Here we tested whether a dynamical systems model based on this hypothesis reproduces observed patterns of human synchronization. We simulated behavior with a model consisting of an oscillator receiving its own delayed activity as input. Three simulation experiments were conducted using previously-published behavioral data from 1) simple tapping, 2) two-person alternating beat-tapping, and 3) two-person alternating rhythm-clapping in the presence of a range of constant auditory TLs. In Experiment 1, our model replicated the larger anticipation observed for longer stimulus intervals and adjusting the amplitude of the delayed feedback reproduced the difference between musicians and non-musicians. In Experiment 2, by connecting two models we replicated the smaller anticipation observed in human joint tapping with bi-directional auditory feedback compared to joint tapping without feedback. In Experiment 3, we varied TLs between two models alternately receiving signals from one another. Results showed reciprocal lags at points of alternation, consistent with behavioral patterns. Overall, our model explains various anticipatory behaviors, and has potential to inform theories of adaptive human synchronization.},

One of the most common scenarios encountered involves the comparison of 2 groups, which includes research designs that are experimental (e.g., random assignment to treatment vs. placebo conditions) and nonexperimental (e.g., testing for gender differences). Familiar measures such as the standardized mean difference (d) or the point-biserial correlation (rpb) characterize the magnitude of the difference between groups, but these effect size measures are sensitive to a number of additional influences. For example, R. E. McGrath and G. J. Meyer (2006) showed that rpb is sensitive to sample base rates, and extending their analysis to situations of unequal variances reveals that d is, too. The probability-based measure A, the nonparametric generalization of what K. O. McGraw and S. P. Wong (1992) called the common language effect size statistic, is insensitive to base rates and more robust to several other factors (e.g., extreme scores, nonlinear transformations). In addition to its excellent generalizability across contexts, A is easy to understand and can be obtained from standard computer output or through simple hand calculations.},

Sixteen young (age = 22.5 {$\pm$} 3.0 yr), healthy individuals were tested with both (31)P-MRS and NIRS during a single testing session. The recovery rate of phosphocreatine was measured inside the bore of a 3-Tesla MRI scanner, after short-duration ({$\sim$}10 s) plantar flexion exercise as an index of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity. Using NIRS, the recovery rate of muscle oxygen consumption was also measured using repeated, transient arterial occlusions outside the MRI scanner, after short-duration ({$\sim$}10 s) plantar flexion exercise as another index of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity. The average recovery time constant was 31.5 {$\pm$} 8.5 s for phosphocreatine and 31.5 {$\pm$} 8.9 s for muscle oxygen consumption for all participants (P = 0.709). (31)P-MRS time constants correlated well with NIRS time constants for both channel 1 (Pearson's r = 0.88, P {$<$} 0.0001) and channel 2 (Pearson's r = 0.95, P {$<$} 0.0001). Furthermore, both (31)P-MRS and NIRS exhibit good repeatability between trials (coefficient of variation = 8.1, 6.9, and 7.9\% for NIRS channel 1, NIRS channel 2, and (31)P-MRS, respectively). The good agreement between NIRS and (31)P-MRS indexes of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity suggest that NIRS is a valid method for assessing mitochondrial function, and that direct comparisons between NIRS and (31)P-MRS measurements may be possible.},

  abstract = {Evidence-based medicine, whose philosophical origins extend back to mid-19th century Paris and earlier, is the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. The practice of evidence-based medicine means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research. By individual clinical expertise we mean the proficiency and judgment that we individual clinicians acquire through clinical experience and clinical practice. Increased expertise is reflected in many ways, but especially in more effective and efficient diagnosis and in the more thoughtful identification and compassionate use of individual patients' predicaments, rights, and preferences in making clinical decisions about their care. By best available external clinical evidence we mean clinically relevant research, often from the basic sciences of medicine, but especially from patient centered clinical research into the accuracy and precision of diagnostic tests (including the clinical examination), the power of prognostic markers, and the efficacy and safety of therapeutic, rehabilitative, and preventive regimens. External clinical evidence both invalidates previously accepted diagnostic tests and treatment and replaces them with new ones that are more powerful, more accurate, more efficacious, and safer. Good doctors use both individual clinical expertise and the best available external evidence, and neither alone is enough. Without clinical expertise, practice risks becoming tyrannized by external evidence, for even excellent external evidence may be inapplicable to or inappropriate for an individual patient. Without current best external evidence, practice risks becoming rapidly out of date, to the detriment of patients. The practice of evidence-based medicine is a process of life-long, self-directed learning in which caring for our own patients creates the need for clinically important information about diagnosis, prognosis, therapy, and other clinical and health care issues, and in which we (1) convert these information needs into answerable questions; (2) track down, with maximum efficiency, the best evidence with which to answer them (whether from the clinical examination, the diagnostic laboratory from research evidence, or other sources); (3) critically appraise that evidence for its validity (closeness to the truth) and usefulness (clincial applicability); (4) integrate this appraisal with our clinical expertise and apply it in practice; and (5) evaluate our performance.},

  abstract = {During a set of resistance exercise performed until exhaustion, the relationship between intensity and the number of repetitions can be affected by lifting speed, with faster speeds producing higher numbers. The hypothesized mechanisms include enhanced utilization of the stretch\textendash shortening cycle. This study investigated muscle activations under varying speeds and intensities during bench press using surface electromyography (EMG) to suggest further mechanisms for the above finding. Thirteen weight-trained men (21.7~{$\pm~$}3.6-year-old) performed bench press until fatigue under five intensities (40\textendash 80\% 1RM), and four speeds (slow 5.6-s/repetition, medium 2.8-s/repetition, fast 1.9-s/repetition, and ballistic maximum speed). Surface EMG was recorded from the pectoralis, deltoid, and triceps for root-mean-square amplitude and median frequency. EMG amplitudes were greater for faster and heavier conditions before fatigue. Faster conditions, however, produced a significant fall in amplitude during the final concentric phase compared to slower movements. After fatigue, EMG amplitude increased, with the speed effect being maintained. The intensity effect on amplitude either disappeared or remained similar, depending on the muscles. Median frequencies before fatigue were similar among speeds and intensities. The fall in frequency after fatigue was similar across speeds, but greater for lighter intensities. It was concluded that reduced muscle activation during the final concentric phase in faster conditions allowed a better muscle pump, explaining the increased repetition numbers. Fatigue levels are likely to have been similar across speeds, but greater for lower intensities. An incomplete rise in EMG amplitude after fatigue for lower intensities could imply an increased contribution of central fatigue or neuromuscular transmission failure.},

Strength performance depends not only on the quantity and quality of the involved muscles, but also upon the ability of the nervous system to appropriately activate the muscles. Strength training may cause adaptive changes within the nervous system that allow a trainee to more fully activate prime movers in specific movements and to better coordinate the activation of all relevant muscles, thereby effecting a greater net force in the intended direction of movement. The evidence indicating neural adaptation is reviewed. Electromyographic studies have provided the most direct evidence. They have shown that increases in peak force and rate offeree development are associated with increased activation of prime mover muscles. Possible reflex adaptations related to high stretch loads in jumping and rapid reciprocal movements have also been revealed. Other studies, including those that demonstrate the ``cross-training'' effect and specificity of training, provide further evidence of neural adaptation. The possible mechanisms of neural adaptation are discussed in relation to motor unit recruitment and firing patterns. The relative roles of neural and muscular adaptation in short- and long-term strength training are evaluated.},

Mean (MV), mean propulsive (MPV) and peak (PV) velocity measures of the concentric phase were analyzed. Both MV and MPV showed a very close relationship to \%1RM (R 2 =0.96), whereas a weaker association (R 2 =0.79) and larger SEE (0.14 vs. 0.06\,m{$\cdot$}s -1 ) were found for PV. Prediction equations to estimate load from velocity were obtained. When dividing the sample into 3 groups of different relative strength (1RM/body mass), no differences were found between groups for the MPV attained against each \%1RM. MV attained with the 1RM was 0.32{$\pm$}0.03\,m{$\cdot$}s -1 . The propulsive phase accounted for \textasciitilde 82\% of concentric duration at 40\% 1RM, and progressively increased until reaching 100\% at 1RM. Provided that repetitions are performed at maximal intended velocity, a good estimation of load (\%1RM) can be obtained from mean velocity as soon as the first repetition is completed. This finding provides an alternative to the often demanding, time-consuming and interfering 1RM or nRM tests and allows implementing a velocity-based resistance training approach.},

Results:~         Mean repetition velocity loss after three sets, loss of velocity pre-post exercise against the 1-m{$\cdot$}s-1 load, and countermovement jump height loss (SQ group) were significant for all REP and were highly correlated to each other (r = 0.91-0.97). Velocity loss was significantly greater for BP compared with SQ and strongly correlated to peak postexercise lactate (r = 0.93-0.97) for both SQ and BP. Unlike lactate, ammonia showed a curvilinear response to loss of velocity, only increasing above resting levels when R was at least two repetitions higher than 50\% of P.         Conclusions:~         Velocity loss and metabolic stress clearly differs when manipulating the number of repetitions actually performed in each training set. The high correlations found between mechanical (velocity and countermovement jump height losses) and metabolic (lactate, ammonia) measures of fatigue support the validity of using velocity loss to objectively quantify neuromuscular fatigue during resistance training.},

Neuronal recordings and activation patterns revealed with neuroimaging methods have shown considerable plasticity of MI representations and cell properties following pathological or traumatic changes and in relation to everyday experience, including motor-skill learning and cognitive motor actions. The intrinsic horizontal neuronal connections in MI are a strong candidate substrate for map reorganization: They interconnect large regions of MI, they show activity-dependent plasticity, and they modify in association with skill learning. These findings suggest that MI cortex is not simply a static motor control structure. It also contains a dynamic substrate that participates in motor learning and possibly in cognitive events as well.},

  abstract = {This year marks the 20th anniversary of functional near-infrared spectroscopy and imaging (fNIRS/fNIRI). As the vast majority of commercial instruments developed until now are based on continuous wave technology, the aim of this publication is to review the current state of instrumentation and methodology of continuous wave fNIRI. For this purpose we provide an overview of the commercially available instruments and address instrumental aspects such as light sources, detectors and sensor arrangements. Methodological aspects, algorithms to calculate the concentrations of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin and approaches for data analysis are also reviewed. From the single-location measurements of the early years, instrumentation has progressed to imaging initially in two dimensions (topography) and then three (tomography). The methods of analysis have also changed tremendously, from the simple modified Beer-Lambert law to sophisticated image reconstruction and data analysis methods used today. Due to these advances, fNIRI has become a modality that is widely used in neuroscience research and several manufacturers provide commercial instrumentation. It seems likely that fNIRI will become a clinical tool in the foreseeable future, which will enable diagnosis in single subjects.},

Twelve well-trained young men performed high-intensity back squat exercise (12 sets at 70\textendash 90\% 1-repetition maximum) on two occasions, during which EMG and NIRS continuously monitored muscle activation and oxygenation of the thigh muscles. Intra-test reliability for EMG and NIRS variables was generally higher than inter-test reliability. EMG median frequency variables were generally more reliable than amplitude-based variables. The reliability of EMG measures was not related to the intensity or number of repetitions performed during the set. No notable differences were evident in the reliability of EMG between different agonist muscles. NIRS-derived measures of oxyhaemoglobin, deoxyhaemoglobin and tissue saturation index were generally more reliable during single-repetition sets than multiple-repetition sets at the same intensity. Tissue saturation index was the most reliable NIRS variable. Although the reliability of the EMG and NIRS measures varied across the exercise protocol, the precise causes of this variability are not yet understood. However, it is likely that biological variation during multi-joint isotonic resistance exercise may account for some of the variation in the observed results.},

However, knowledge on brain processing during the execution of whole-body balance tasks is still limited. In the present study, we investigated brain activity during slacklining, a task with a high demand on balance capabilities, which is frequently used as supplementary training in various sports disciplines as well as for lower extremity prevention and rehabilitation purposes in clinical settings. We assessed hemodynamic response alterations in sensorimotor brain areas using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during standing (ST) and walking (WA) on a slackline in 16 advanced slackliners. We expected to observe task-related differences between both conditions as well as associations between cortical activity and slacklining experience. While our results revealed hemodynamic response alterations in sensorimotor brain regions such as primary motor cortex (M1), premotor cortex (PMC), and supplementary motor cortex (SMA) during both conditions, we did not observe differential effects between ST and WA nor associations between cortical activity and slacklining experience. In summary, these findings provide novel insights into brain processing during a whole-body balance task and its relation to balance expertise. As maintaining balance is considered an important prerequisite in daily life and crucial in the context of prevention and rehabilitation, future studies should extend these findings by quantifying brain processing during task execution on a whole-brain level.},

Quantifying training success is typically accompanied by performance diagnostics including the assessment of sports-relevant behavioral and physiological parameters. Even though optimal brain processing is a key factor for augmented motor performance and skill learning, neurodiagnostics is typically not implemented in performance diagnostics of athletes. We propose, that neurodiagnostics via non-invasive brain imaging techniques such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) will offer novel perspectives to quantify training-induced neuroplasticity and its relation to motor behavior. A better understanding of such a brain-behavior relationship during the execution of sport-specific movements might help to guide training processes and to optimize training outcomes. Furthermore, targeted non-invasive brain stimulation such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) might help to further enhance training outcomes by modulating brain areas that show training-induced neuroplasticity. However, we strongly suggest that ethical aspects in the use of non-invasive brain stimulation during training and/or competition need to be addressed before neuromodulation can be considered as a performance enhancer in sports.},

The purpose of the present study was to unravel differences in motor skill learning and associated functional neuroplasticity between endurance athletes (EA) and nonathletes (NA). For this purpose, participants had to perform a multimodal balance task (MBT) training on 2 sessions, which were separated by 1 wk. Before and after MBT training, a static balance task (SBT) had to be performed. MBT-induced functional neuroplasticity and neuromuscular alterations were assessed by means of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electromyography (EMG) during SBT performance. We hypothesized that EA would showed superior initial SBT performance and stronger MBT-induced improvements in SBT learning rates compared with NA. On a cortical level, we hypothesized that MBT training would lead to differential learning-dependent functional changes in motor-related brain regions [such as primary motor cortex (M1)] during SBT performance. In fact, EA showed superior initial SBT performance, whereas learning rates did not differ between groups. On a cortical level, fNIRS recordings (time \texttimes{} group interaction) revealed a stronger MBT-induced decrease in left M1 and inferior parietal lobe (IPL) for deoxygenated hemoglobin in EA. Even more interesting, learning rates were correlated with fNIRS changes in right M1/IPL. On the basis of these findings, we provide novel evidence for superior MBT training-induced functional neuroplasticity in highly trained athletes. Future studies should investigate these effects in different sports disciplines to strengthen previous work on experience-dependent neuroplasticity. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Motor expertise is associated with functional/structural brain plasticity. How such neuroplastic reorganization translates into altered motor learning processes remains elusive. We investigated endurance athletes (EA) and nonathletes (NA) in a multimodal balance task (MBT). EA showed superior static balance performance (SBT), whereas MBT-induced SBT improvements did not differ between groups. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy recordings revealed a differential MBT training-induced decrease of deoxygenated hemoglobin in left primary motor cortex and inferior parietal lobe between groups.},

However, knowledge about its effects on brain function and structure is rather sparse. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate exercise-dependent adaptations in neurovascular coupling to different intensity levels in motor-related brain regions. Moreover, expertise effects between trained endurance athletes (EA) and active control participants (ACP) during a cycling test were investigated using multi-distance functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Initially, participants performed an incremental cycling test (ICT) to assess peak values of power output (PPO) and cardiorespiratory parameters such as oxygen consumption volume (VO2max) and heart rate (HRmax). In a second session, participants cycled individual intensity levels of 20, 40, and 60\% of PPO while measuring cardiorespiratory responses and neurovascular coupling. Our results revealed exercise-induced decreases of deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb), indicating an increased activation in motor-related brain areas such as primary motor cortex (M1) and premotor cortex (PMC). However, we could not find any differential effects in brain activation between EA and ACP. Future studies should extend this approach using whole-brain configurations and systemic physiological augmented fNIRS measurements, which seems to be of pivotal interest in studies aiming to assess neural activation in a sports-related context.},

A high order derivative method based on continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is discussed in the analysis of near infrared (NIR) spectra. The results for a simulated spectrum obtained from conventional numerical differentiation (NM), Fourier transform (FT), Savitzky\textendash Golay (SG) and CWT method were compared. CWT method was found to be as efficient as FT and SG, but easier for high order derivative computation, and the fourth order derivative was proved to be a good choice for resolution enhancement as well as reduction of noise and sidelobe effects. For the NIR spectra of water\textendash ethanol mixtures, the complexity of the spectra can be observed from the fourth derivative, including the spectral features of OH and CH with various intermolecular interactions. Fitting the derivative spectra of the mixtures by those of pure water and ethanol, the obtained coefficients for ethanol show a linear relation with the content but that for water exhibit a non\textendash linear relation, which reveals the influence of ethanol on water structure in the mixture. Furthermore, the information of the water\textendash ethanol clusters was found in the residual spectra after the fitting. Therefore, high order derivative can be an efficient way to improve the resolution of NIR spectra for understanding the interactions in aqueous solutions.},

  abstract = {Background: At present, the effects of upper limb movement are generally evaluated from the level of motor performance. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the response of the cerebral cortex to different upper limb movement patterns from the perspective of neurophysiology.Method: Thirty healthy adults (12 females, 18 males, mean age 23.9 {$\pm$} 0.9 years) took resistance and non-resistance exercises under four trajectories (T1: left and right straight-line movement; T2: front and back straight-line movement; T3: clockwise and anticlockwise drawing circle movement; and T4: clockwise and anticlockwise character ⁕ movement). Each movement included a set of periodic motions composed of a 30-s task and a 30-s rest. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to measure cerebral blood flow dynamics. Primary somatosensory cortex (S1), supplementary motor area (SMA), pre-motor area (PMA), primary motor cortex (M1), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were chosen as regions of interests (ROIs). Activation maps and symmetric heat maps were applied to assess the response of the cerebral cortex to different motion patterns.Result: The activation of the brain cortex was significantly increased during resistance movement for each participant. Specifically, S1, SMA, PMA, and M1 had higher participation during both non-resistance movement and resistance movement. Compared to non-resistance movement, the resistance movement caused an obvious response in the cerebral cortex. The task state and the resting state were distinguished more obviously in the resistance movement. Four trajectories can be distinguished under non-resistance movement.Conclusion: This study confirmed that the response of the cerebral motor cortex to different motion patterns was different from that of the neurophysiological level. It may provide a reference for the evaluation of resistance training effects in the future.},

This article presents applications of multivariate autoregression (MVAR) modeling for analyzing the interaction between EEG and EMG, which is challenging because of their different modalities. In contrast to previous research employing the MVAR modeling by means of frequency-domain analysis, our approach emphasizes time-domain analysis. We examined one normal subject and one mirror-movement (MM) patient. The task was a weak isotonic contraction of the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle in the normal subject, and the left extensor carpi radialis brevis in the MM patient. For each subject, three channels consisting of two EEG signals and one EMG signal were analyzed. The EMG signals were from the bilateral primary sensorimotor cortices. By using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and by choosing the appropriate data length, the model order was determined in a stable fashion. Our results provided plausible information on EEG\textendash EMG networks: (1) Information-transmission-delay time that seems physiologically appropriate, and (2) relative contribution from the ipsi- and contralateral corticospinal pathway, which is opposite in the normal subject in comparison to MM patients.},

All subjects performed at 120\% of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2peak) on a cycle ergometer until reaching a state of volitional fatigue. Cerebral oxygenation was measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) throughout the supramaximal constant exhaustive exercise. RESULTS: The mean exercise duration of the subjects was 147.2+/-3.4 s. The peak value of blood lactate concentration within 3-10 min after the exercise test was 14.4+/-0.1 mmol/l. Cerebral oxygenation (8.8+/-1.8 micromol/l) was increased significantly during the first minutes of exercise compared with the pre-exercise value (p{$<$}0.05) and cerebral oxygenation decreased with the passage of time during exercise. Cerebral oxygenation at the end of exercise decreased significantly compared with the resting value (-29.9+/-3.4 micromol/l, p{$<$}0.05).

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measured corticospinal excitability (CSE) and intracortical inhibition (ICI) of the biceps brachii muscle in 42 healthy subjects that were randomised to either paced-strength-training (PST, n~=~11), self-paced strength-training (SPST, n~=~11), isometric strength-training (IST, n~=~10) or to a control group (n~=~10). Single-pulse and paired-pulse TMS were applied prior to and following 4-weeks of strength-training. PST increased CSE compared to SPST, IST and the control group (all P~{$<~$}0.05). ICI was only reduced (60\%) following PST. Dynamic strength increased by 18 and 25\% following PST and SPST, whilst isometric strength increased by 20\% following IST. There were no associations between the behavioural outcome measures and the change in CSE and ICI. The corticospinal responses to strength-training are task-dependent, which is a new finding. Strength-training that is performed slowly could promote use-dependent plasticity in populations with reduced volitional drive, such as during periods of limb immobilization, musculoskeletal injury or stroke.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Resistance-training causes changes in the central nervous system (CNS); however, the sites of these adaptations remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine sites of neural adaptation to resistance-training by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis on the cortical and subcortical responses to resistance-training. METHODS: Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that focused on neural adaptations to resistance-training was pooled to assess effect estimates for changes in strength, cortical, and subcortical adaptations. RESULTS: The magnitude of strength gain in 30 RCTs (n\,=\,623) reported a standardised mean difference (SMD) of 0.67 (95\% CI 0.41, 0.94; P\,{$<$}\,0.001) that measured at least one cortical/subcortical neural adaptation which included: motor-evoked potentials (MEP; 19 studies); silent period (SP; 7 studies); short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI; 7 studies); cervicomedullary evoked potentials (CMEP; 1 study); transcranial magnetic stimulation voluntary activation (VATMS; 2 studies); H-reflex (10 studies); and V-wave amplitudes (5 studies). The MEP amplitude during voluntary contraction was greater following resistance-training (SMD 0.55; 95\% CI 0.27, 0.84; P\,{$<$}\,0.001, n\,=\,271), but remained unchanged during rest (SMD 0.49; 95\% CI -0.68, 1.66; P\,=\,0.41, n\,=\,114). Both SP (SMD 0.65; 95\% CI 0.29, 1.01; P\,{$<$}\,0.001, n\,=\,184) and active SICI (SMD 0.68; 95\% CI 0.14, 1.23; P\,=\,0.01, n\,=\,102) decreased, but resting SICI remained unchanged (SMD 0.26; 95\% CI -\,0.29, 0.81; P\,=\,0.35, n\,=\,52). Resistance-training improved neural drive as measured by V-wave amplitude (SMD 0.62; 95\% CI 0.14, 1.10; P\,=\,0.01, n\,=\,101), but H-reflex at rest (SMD 0.16; 95\% CI -\,0.36, 0.68; P\,=\,0.56; n\,=\,57), during contraction (SMD 0.15; 95\% CI -\,0.18, 0.48; P\,=\,0.38, n\,=\,142) and VATMS (MD 1.41; 95\% CI -\,4.37, 7.20; P\,=\,0.63, n\,=\,44) remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: There are subtle neural adaptations following resistance-training involving both cortical and subcortical adaptations that act to increase motoneurone activation and likely contribute to the training-related increase in muscle strength.},

Eight healthy volunteers participated in two experimental sessions. In one session, subjects performed isometric elbow-flexion contractions at four intensity levels [10\%, 35\%, 60\%, and 85\% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)]. In another session, a given elbow-flexion force (35\% MVC) was generated at three different rates (slow, intermediate, and fast). Thirty to 40 contractions were performed at each force level or rate. EEG signals were recorded from the scalp overlying the supplementary motor area (SMA) and contralateral sensorimotor cortex, and EMG signals were recorded from the skin surface overlying the belly of the biceps brachii and brachioradialis muscles during all contractions. In each trial, the force was used as the triggering signal for MRCP averaging. MRCP amplitude was measured from the beginning to the peak of the negative slope. The magnitude of MRCP from both EEG recording locations (sensorimotor cortex and SMA) was highly correlated with elbow-flexion force, rate of rising of force, and muscle EMG signals. These results suggest that MRCP represents cortical motor commands that scale the level of muscle activation.},

However, this is difficult to achieve in functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) because fNIRS data are primary obtained from the head surface and lack structural information of the measured brain. Therefore, in our previous articles, we presented a method for probabilistic registration of fNIRS data to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template through international 10-20 system without using the subject's magnetic resonance image (MRI). In the current study, we demonstrate our method with a new statistical model to facilitate group studies and provide information on different components of variability. We adopt an analysis similar to the single-factor one-way classification analysis of variance based on random effects model to examine the variability involved in our improvised method of probabilistic registration of fNIRS data. We tested this method by registering head surface data of twelve subjects to seventeen reference MRI data sets and found that the standard deviation in probabilistic registration thus performed for given head surface points is approximately within the range of 4.7 to 7.0 mm. This means that, if the spatial registration error is within an acceptable tolerance limit, it is possible to perform multi-subject fNIRS analysis to make inference at the population level and to provide information on positional variability in the population, even when subjects' MRIs are not available. In essence, the current method enables the multi-subject fNIRS data to be presented in the MNI space with clear description of associated positional variability. Such data presentation on a common platform, will not only strengthen the validity of the population analysis of fNIRS studies, but will also facilitate both intra- and inter-modal data sharing among the neuroimaging community.},

Yet questions persist about how the CNS combines these primitives in different ways to suit the task conditions. The MShypothesis has been a subject of debate as to whether they originate from neural origins or nonneural constraints. In this review article, we present three aspects related to the MS hypothesis: (1) the experimental and computational evidence in support of theexistence of MS, (2) algorithmic approaches for extracting them from surface electromyography (EMG) signals, and (3) the possible role of MS as a neurorehabilitation tool. We note that recent advances in computational neuroscience have utilized theMS hypothesis in motor control and learning. Prospective advances in clinical, medical, and engineering sciences and in fields such as robotics and rehabilitation stand to benefit from a more thorough understanding of MS.

  abstract = {The initial increases in force production with resistance training are thought to be primarily underpinned by neural adaptations. This notion is firmly supported by evidence displaying motor unit adaptations following resistance training; however, the precise locus of neural adaptation remains elusive. The purpose of this review is to clarify and critically discuss the literature concerning the site(s) of putative neural adaptations to short-term resistance training. The proliferation of studies employing non-invasive stimulation techniques to investigate evoked responses have yielded variable results, but generally support the notion that resistance training alters intracortical inhibition. Nevertheless, methodological inconsistencies and the limitations of techniques, e.g. limited relation to behavioural outcomes and the inability to measure volitional muscle activity, preclude firm conclusions. Much of the literature has focused on the corticospinal tract; however, preliminary research in non-human primates suggests reticulospinal tract is a potential substrate for neural adaptations to resistance training, though human data is lacking due to methodological constraints. Recent advances in technology have provided substantial evidence of adaptations within a large motor unit population following resistance training. However, their activity represents the transformation of afferent and efferent inputs, making it challenging to establish the source of adaptation. Whilst much has been learned about the nature of neural adaptations to resistance training, the puzzle remains to be solved. Additional analyses of motoneuron firing during different training regimes or coupling with other methodologies (e.g., electroencephalography) may facilitate the estimation of the site(s) of neural adaptations to resistance training in the future.},

The purpose of this study was to compare lower extremity muscle activation patterns during different squat techniques. Twenty-eight healthy, uninjured subjects (19 women, 9 men, 21.5 {$\pm$} 3 years, 170 {$\pm$} 8.4 cm, 65.7 {$\pm$} 11.8 kg) volunteered. Electromyography (EMG) electrodes were placed on the vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, rectus femoris, biceps femoris, and the gastrocnemius of the dominant leg. Participants completed 5 squats while purposefully displacing the knee anteriorly (AP malaligned), 5 squats while purposefully displacing the knee medially (ML malaligned) and 5 squats with control alignment (control). Normalized EMG data (MVIC) were reduced to 100 points and represented as percentage of squat cycle with 50\% representing peak knee flexion and 0 and 99\% representing fully extended. Vastus lateralis, medialis, and rectus femoris activity decreased in the medio-lateral (ML) malaligned squat compared with the control squat. In the antero-posterior (AP) malaligned squat, the vastus lateralis, medialis, and rectus femoris activity decreased during initial descent and final ascent; however, vastus lateralis and rectus femoris activation increased during initial ascent compared with the control squat. The biceps femoris and gastrocnemius displayed increased activation during both malaligned squats compared with the control squat. In conclusion, participants had altered muscle activation patterns during squats with intentional frontal and sagittal malalignment as demonstrated by changes in quadriceps, biceps femoris, and gastrocnemius activation during the squat cycle.},

Material and method Finger tapping behavior of 16 adults who stutter (PWS) was compared with that of 16 matching controls (PNS) in five rhythmic tasks of various complexity: three synchronization tasks \rule{1em}{1pt} a simple 1:1 isochronous pattern, a complex non-isochronous pattern, and a 4 tap:1 beat isochronous pattern \rule{1em}{1pt}, a reaction task to an aperiodic and unpredictable pattern, and a reproduction task of an isochronous pattern after passively listening. Results PWS were able to reproduce an isochronous pattern on their own, without external auditory stimuli, with similar accuracy as PNS, but with increased variability. This group difference in variability was observed immediately after passive listening, without prior motor engagement, and was not enhanced or reduced after several seconds of tapping. Although PWS showed increased tapping variability in the reproduction task as well as in synchronization tasks, this timing variability did not correlate significantly with the variability in reaction times or tapping force. Compared to PNS, PWS exhibited larger negative mean asynchronies, and increased synchronization variability in synchronization tasks. These group differences were not affected by beat hierarchy (i.e., ``strong'' vs. ``weak'' beats), pattern complexity (non-isochronous vs. isochronous) or presence versus absence of external auditory stimulus (1:1 vs. 1:4 isochronous pattern). Differences between PWS and PNS were not enhanced or reduced with sensorimotor learning, over the first taps of a synchronization task. Conclusion Our observations support the hypothesis of a deficit in neuronal oscillators coupling in production, but not in perception, of rhythmic patterns, and a larger delay in multi-modal feedback processing for PWS.},

Three components of MRP (Bereitschaftspotential, BP, motor potential, MP, and movement-monitoring potential, MMP) associated with isometric force output were identified and examined. Our principal finding for the MRP amplitude showed that only MMP, not BP and MP, was enhanced at higher rates of force development for both speed and accuracy tasks. That is to say, there was a high correlation between MMP peak amplitude and the rate of force development for both repetitive and discrete force-production tasks. Additionally, the amplitude of MMP was consistently higher for fast, rather than accurate, force outputs. Moreover, the results from analysis of MRP onset times suggest that, in general, the MRP begin earlier for the fast force output than for the accurate force output.},

An in-situ study was set-up (N = 22), in which each participant took 15 penalties under three different pressure conditions: without a goalkeeper, with an amiable goalkeeper, and with a competitive goalkeeper. Both experienced and inexperienced soccer players were recruited, and the brain activation was compared across groups. Besides, fNIRS activation was compared between sessions that participants felt anxious against sessions without anxiety report, and between penalty-scoring and -missing sessions. The results show that the task-relevant brain region, the motor cortex, was more activated when players were not experiencing performance anxiety. The activation of task-irrelevant areas was shown to be related to players experiencing anxiety and missing penalties, especially the prefrontal cortex (PFC). More particularly, an overall higher activation of the PFC and an increase of PFC lateral asymmetry were related to anxious players and missed penalties, which can be caused by players' worries about the consequences of scoring or missing the penalty kicks. When experienced players were feeling anxious, their left temporal cortex activation increased, which could be an indication that experienced overthink the situation and neglect their automated skills. Besides, the left temporal cortex activation is higher when inexperienced players succeeded to score a penalty. Overall, the results of this study are in line with the neural efficiency theory and demonstrate the feasibility and ecological validity to detect neurological clues relevant to anxiety and performance from fNIRS recordings in the field.},

Nine healthy young individuals completed the dynamic tasks before and after they squatted with a standard Olympic bar until complete exhaustion. Electromyography (EMG) profiles were analyzed with a novel concatenated non-negative matrix factorization method that decomposed EMG signals into muscle synergies. Muscle synergy analysis provides the activation pattern of the muscles while continuous wavelet transforms output the temporal frequency content of the EMG signals. Synergy analysis revealed subtle changes in two-legged squatting after fatigue while differences in one-legged squatting were more pronounced and included the shift from a general co-activation of muscles in the pre-fatigue state to a knee extensor dominant weighting post-fatigue. Continuous wavelet transforms showed major frequency content decreases in two-legged squatting after fatigue while very few frequency changes occurred in one-legged squatting. It was observed that the combination of methods is an effective way of describing muscle fatigue and that muscle activation patterns play a very important role in maintaining the overall joint kinetics after fatigue.},

Sixteen men (age: 20.7 {$\pm$} 1.1 years) performed 4 sets of 20 repetitions with an initial load of 50\% of 1 repetition maximum (1RM), and 2 minutes of rest, in the squat exercise. Furthermore, the subjects performed 4 repetitions with loads of 40 and 80\% of 1RM before, immediately after, and 30 minutes after the end of the session. Average power and EMG activity from vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL), and rectus femoris (RF) were recorded during the concentric phase of the lift. Average power did not change during the first 2 sets, while it decreased (p {$<$} 0.05) during the third and the fourth set. Average quadriceps (AQ), VM, VL, and RF activity increased (p {$<$} 0.05) until the 11th repetition, approximately, during each set while it increased gradually from set to set. Maximal power and AQ, VM, and VL activity with the loads of 40 and 80\% of 1RM were decreased (p {$<$} 0.05) after the session. Blood lactate reached 10.2 {$\pm$} 2.5 and 13.1 {$\pm$} 4.1 mmol{$\cdot$}L-1 after the second and the fourth set, respectively. It appears that during a muscular endurance session with submaximal power output, mechanical performance may gradually decrease, probably due to metabolic fatigue, while muscle electrical activity may increase. Following this type of a session, maximal power output and muscle activation with a light and especially with a heavy load are reduced.},

  abstract = {Purpose:~         Wavelet transform is a time-frequency analysis method that quantifies temporal changes of the frequency content of nonstationary signals without losing resolution in time or frequency. It may be used to analyze surface EMG (sEMG) signals under dynamic conditions. However, this method is difficult to apply clinically because it generates large quantity of data in a very short time, and the change in muscle fiber length and diameter during dynamic contraction induces a large variability of the data at various wavelet domains and joint positions. This study aimed to determine a wavelet domain and a joint range that has the lowest variance and highest sensitivity to document the shift of the frequency intensity that relates to the decline of dynamic muscle power.         Methods:~         Eleven active young males were tested for maximal isokinetic knee extension and flexion exercise for 50 repetitions at 180\textdegree{$\cdot$}s-1 and at a range of 100\textdegree -0\textdegree. sEMG measurement of vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL), and rectus femoris (RF) were recorded during the exercise. Wavelet transform was used to filter the sEMG data into 11 wavelet domains. The movement was divided into five 20\textdegree -angle range groups.         Results:~         On the basis of the statistical analysis, the most significant and consistent trend of decrease in sEMG intensity power under maximal dynamic exercise for VM, VL, and RF was identified at the angle range of 40\textdegree -20\textdegree{} in wavelet domain 4.         Conclusion:~         We concluded that the shift in intensity within this angle range and wavelet domain might be used to document fatigue of the quadriceps during dynamic maximal knee extension exercise.},

  abstract = {The current body of evidence suggests that both acute and chronic exercise have a positive impact on executive function (i.e., top-down mental processes for achieving internal goals). Previous reviews have mainly focused on the effects of aerobic exercise, whereas possible benefits following resistance training have received far less attention. Therefore, the present review examines both the acute and long-term effects of resistance training on the three core facets of executive function (inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility). Comparing the effects of resistance training on different subcomponents, benefits were most pronounced for inhibitory control in both the acute and long-term exercise paradigms. Although some studies also reported positive effects of resistance training on working memory and cognitive flexibility, the interpretation of these improvements is limited due to heterogeneous findings and a small number of studies. Thus, it is premature to conclude that resistance training selectively benefits the inhibitory aspect of executive function. Further, it remains unclear how frequency, duration, and intensity of resistance training influence such cognitive enhancements. Consequently, future studies are encouraged to address possible influences of exercise characteristics on the subcomponents of executive function, and to further examine the effects of resistance training across all age groups.},

Eleven National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I baseball position players (19.4 {$\pm$} 1.0 years; 182.4 {$\pm$} 6.5 cm; and 87.2 {$\pm$} 7.4 kg) performed trials at maximum speed with loads of 30, 50, 70, and 90\% of their predetermined 1 repetition maximum (1RM) for both BS and FS. Peak and mean velocity was recorded during each repetition using an accelerometer. Differences between exercises and relative loading were assessed by separate 2 \texttimes{} 4 (condition \texttimes{} relative load) repeated-measures analysis of variance for mean and peak velocity. In addition, the load-velocity relationship across submaximal loadings in BS and FS were further assessed by calculating their respective slopes and comparing slopes through a paired-samples t-test. No significant condition \texttimes{} relative load interactions were noted for mean velocity (p = 0.072) or peak velocity (p = 0.203). Likewise, no significant differences in the slope for BS and FS were noted for mean velocity (p = 0.057) or peak velocity (p = 0.196). However, significant main effects for relative load were noted for both mean and peak velocity (p {$<$} 0.001), whereby mean and peak velocity were progressively reduced across all relative loads (i.e., 30, 50, 70, and 90\% 1RM) for both the BS and FS. Our results demonstrate that the load-velocity relationships of the BS and FS exercises seem to be similar; therefore, similar approaches may be used with these squat variations when monitoring barbell velocity or implementing velocity-based strength training.},

In this study, we employed a dyadic juggling paradigm and electroencephalography (EEG) hyperscanning to evaluate functional connectivity between EEG sources within and between jugglers' brains during individual and interactive juggling. We applied graph theoretical measures to identify significant differences in functional connectivity between the individual and interactive juggling conditions. Connectivity was measured in multiple juggler pairs with various skill levels where dyads were either skill-level matched or skill-level unmatched. We observed that global efficiency was reduced during paired juggling for less skilled jugglers and increased for more skilled jugglers. When jugglers were skill-level matched, additional reductions were found in the mean clustering coefficient and small-world topology during interactive juggling. A significant difference in hemispheric brain lateralization was detected between skill-level matched and skill-level unmatched jugglers during interactive juggling: matched jugglers had an increased right hemisphere lateralization while unmatched jugglers had an increased left hemisphere lateralization. These results reveal multiple differences in functional brain networks during individual and interactive juggling and suggest that similarities and disparities in individual skills can impact inter-brain dynamics in the performance and learning of motor tasks.},

Based on the existing literature, there is a strong physiological rationale for the incorporation of eccentric training into a training program for an individual seeking to maximize muscle size, strength, and power. Specific adaptations may include an increase in muscle cross-sectional area, force output, and fiber shortening velocities, all of which have the potential to benefit power production characteristics. Tempo eccentric training, flywheel inertial training, accentuated eccentric loading, and plyometric training are commonly implemented in applied contexts. These methods tend to involve different force absorption characteristics and thus, overload the muscle or musculotendinous unit in different ways during lengthening actions. For this reason, they may produce different magnitudes of improvement in hypertrophy, strength, and power. The constraints to which they are implemented can have a marked effect on the characteristics of force absorption and therefore, could affect the nature of the adaptive response. However, the versatility of the constraints when prescribing these methods mean that they can be effectively implemented to induce these adaptations within a variety of populations.},

Each method has advantages and disadvantages that strength and conditioning practitioners should be aware of when measuring and monitoring strength characteristics. The linear loading and 2-for-2 methods may be beneficial for novice athletes; however, they may be limited in their capacity to provide athletes with variation and detrimental if used exclusively for long periods of time.

An athlete's daily readiness can be addressed to various extents by both subjective (e.g., RPE, repetitions in reserve, set-repetition best, and APRE) and objective (e.g., VBT) load adjustment methods. Future resistance training monitoring may aim to include a combination of measures that quantify outcome (e.g., velocity, load, time, etc.) with process (e.g., variability, coordination, efficiency, etc.) relevant to the stage of learning or the task being performed. Load adjustment and monitoring methods should be used to supplement and guide the practitioner, quantify what the practitioner `sees', and provide longitudinal data to assist in reviewing athlete development and providing baselines for the rate of expected development in resistance training when an athlete returns to sport from injury or large training load reductions.},

Exclusion criteria were congenital ACL deficiency and any other major knee injury (defined as an injury requiring surgery or rehabilitation {$>$}3 months) on either knee. 3D and force plate parameters included in the analysis were knee moment, ground-reaction force, and vertical jump height measured during drop vertical jump and vertical single-limb hop. Paired t tests and equivalency analyses were used to compare the parameters between cases (ITB ACLR limb) and controls (contralateral/nonsurgical limbs).Results:Paired t tests showed no statistically significant differences between limbs, and equivalency analyses confirmed equivalency between limbs for all tested outcome variables.Conclusion:The ITB ACLR appears to restore normal, symmetric, physiologic kinetic and kinematic function in the growing knee by 1 year after reconstruction, with maintenance of normal parameters for up to 20 years.},

Great advances have been made in the measurement and interpretation of electromyographic signals recorded on surfaces. It is a practical way to assess exercise fatigue with the use of electromyographic features. With the development of machine learning, the application of sEMG signals in human evaluation has been developed.

Kinematic measurements give the movements of the body segments, which can be compared with normal controls to identify pathological gait patterns, but they do not deal with the forces controlling the movements. As a major goal of scientifically minded clinicians is to understand the biomechanical forces producing movements, the objective measurement of ground reaction forces is essential. The force plate (platform) is now an indispensable tool in a state-of-the-art motion analysis laboratory. Nonetheless, it is not a stand-alone instrument as both kinematic and EMG measurements are needed for maximum clinical implementation and interpretation of force plate measurements. The subject of energy assessment is also given mention, as there is a compelling interest in whether walking has been made easier with intervention. The goals of this manuscript are to provide a historical background, recognize some of the important contributors, and describe the current multiple uses of the force plate in gait analysis. The widespread use of force plates for postural analyses is an important and more recent application of this technology, but this review will be restricted to measurements of gait rather than balance activities. Finally, this manuscript presents my personal perspective and discusses the developments and contributors that have shaped my thoughts and actions, and which I have found to be particularly noteworthy or intriguing. Just as in parts I and II, emphasis has been placed on the early development. All subtopics and important contributors, in this third and certainly most challenging of the review papers, have not been included. Some may find that my perceptions are incomplete. I accept responsibility for all deficiencies, as none were intended. Letters to selected contributors and their responses reveal how each contributor built on the work of others. The level of cooperation and sharing by these early investigators is extraordinary. Had they wished to withhold information about their own work, clinical gait analysis would have been severely delayed.},

During the acceleration periods immediately preceded reaching the steady walking or running speed, the levels of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb) increased, but those of deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxyHb) did not in the frontal cortices. The changes were greater at the higher locomotor speed in the bilateral prefrontal cortex and the premotor cortex, but there were less speed-associated changes in the sensorimotor cortices. The medial prefrontal activation was most prominent during the running task. These results indicate that the prefrontal and premotor cortices are involved in adapting to locomotor speed on the treadmill. These areas might predominantly participate in the control of running rather than walking.},

Purpose This review outlines key applications of supervised and unsupervised machine learning in musculoskeletal medicine; such as diagnostic imaging, patient measurement data, and clinical decision support. The current literature base is examined to identify areas where ML performs equal to or more accurately than human levels. Implications Potential is apparent for intelligent machines to enhance various areas of physiotherapy practice through automization of tasks which involve data analysis, classification and prediction. Changes to service provision through applications of ML, should encourage physiotherapists to increase their awareness of and experiences with emerging technologies. Data literacy should be a component of professional development plans to assist physiotherapists in the application of ML and the preparation of information technology systems to use these techniques.},

The aim of the study was to investigate differences in corticospinal and spinal responses to resistance training of the tibialis anterior muscle between shortening or lengthening muscle contractions for 4 weeks and after 2 weeks of detraining. Thirty-one untrained individuals were assigned to either shortening or lengthening isokinetic resistance training (4 weeks, 3 days/weeks) or a non-training control group. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) were used to assess corticospinal and spinal changes, respectively, at pre-, mid-, post-resistance training and post detraining. Greater increases changes (P {$<$} 0.01) in MVC were found from the respective muscle contraction training. Motor evoked potentials (expressed relative to background EMG) significantly increased in lengthening resistance training group under contraction intensities ranging from 25 to 80\% of the shortening and lengthening contraction intensity (P {$<$} 0.01). In the shortening resistance training group increases were only seen at 50 and 80\% of both contraction type. Volitional drive (V-wave) showed a greater increase following lengthening resistance training (57\%) during maximal lengthening contractions compared to maximal shortening contractions following shortening resistance training (23\%; P {$<$} 0.001). During the detraining period MVC and V-wave did not change (P {$>$} 0.05), although MEP amplitude decreased during the detraining period (P {$<$} 0.01). No changes in H-reflex were found pre to post resistance training or post detraining. Modulation in V-wave appeared to be contraction specific, whereby greatest increases occurred following lengthening resistance training. Strength and volitional drive is maintained following 2 weeks detraining, however corticospinal excitability appears to decrease when the training stimulus is withdrawn.},

  abstract = {Optimal strategies for enhancing strength and improving motor skills are vital in athletic performance and clinical rehabilitation. Initial increases in strength and the acquisition of new motor skills have long been attributed to neurological adaptations. However, early increases in strength may be predominantly due to improvements in inter-muscular coordination rather than the force generating capacity of the muscle. Despite the plethora of research investigating neurological adaptations from motor skill or resistance training in isolation, little effort has been made in consolidating this research to compare motor skill and resistance training adaptations. The findings of this review demonstrated that motor skill and resistance training adaptations show similar short-term mechanisms of adaptations, particularly at a cortical level. Increases in corticospinal excitability and a release in short-interval cortical inhibition occur as a result of the commencement of both resistance and motor skill training. Spinal changes show evidence of task-specific adaptations from the acquired motor skill, with an increase or decrease in spinal reflex excitability, dependant on the motor task. An increase in synaptic efficacy of the reticulospinal projections is likely to be a prominent mechanism for driving strength adaptations at the subcortical level, though more research is needed. Transcranial electric stimulation has been shown to increase corticospinal excitability and augment motor skill adaptations, but limited evidence exists for further enhancing strength adaptations from resistance training. Despite the logistical challenges, future work should compare the longitudinal adaptations between motor skill and resistance training to further optimise exercise programming.},

Successful performance in sport is contingent upon key cognitive skills such as attention, perception, working memory and decision-making.

Neuroimaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) offer the potential to investigate the cognitive demands of sport, neuroplasticity of athletes, and biofeedback training. However, practical and technical limitations of these methods have generally limited their use to laboratory-based studies of athletes during simulated sporting tasks.

Gray matter volume increase in the prefrontal cortex correlated positively with subject's performance improvements during a 6 week learning period. Furthermore, we found that microstructural changes of fractional anisotropy in corresponding white matter regions followed the same temporal dynamic in relation to task performance.

While this transition from tradition-based training to evidence-based training framework has been an improvement in training practices, we argue that the future of strength training will also incorporate deep learning models powered by data. We refer to this data-driven framework as precision strength training inspired by the similar modeling frameworks used in precision medicine. In contrast to current personalised training in which the acquired athlete data is often subject to human expert decision-making, we are anticipating the rise of human-in-the-loop systems with an augmented coach who will be doing decisions collaboratively with the machine. Similar to other precision frameworks, such as precision health, we envision such a future to take decades to be realised and we focus here on practical short-term targets on a way to long-term realisation. In this chapter, we will review the measurement technology needed for continuous data acquisition from an individual during training/physical activity, how to acquire these datasets for the development of such systems and, how a proof-of-concept system could be developed for powerlifting training with applicability to general strength and conditioning (S\&C) and physical rehabilitation purposes.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Real-time measurement of dynamic brain activity during exercise can help advance our understanding of the role of exercise upon brain health and function. In exercise science, functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has primarily been used to measure the effects of exercise intensity on hemodynamic responses in the cerebral cortex. However, the utility of fNIRS to measure discreet hemodynamic responses underlying brain activation associated with motor and cognitive function during exercise has not been systematically examined. Here, we compared brain activation associated with a motor and cognitive task at rest and during cycling exercise at different intensities. METHODS: In separate sessions, 13 participants performed cycling exercise on an indoor trainer at a low, moderate and high intensity. We measured changes in oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated (HbR) hemoglobin from prefrontal, parietal, and motor regions of the cerebral cortex during a handgrip and working-memory task. RESULTS: Our findings show significant brain activation (a concurrent increase in HbO and decrease in HbR) in contralateral motor cortex during the handgrip task and left prefrontal cortex during the working-memory task at rest and during exercise at low, moderate and high (motor task HbO only) intensities (P {$<$} 0.05). Moreover, brain activation during the handgrip and working-memory tasks was not significantly different at rest and during exercise (P {$>$} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that fNIRS can robustly measure motor and cognitive task-evoked changes in brain activation during cycling exercise comparable to rest. An implication of these new findings is that fNIRS can be used to determine real-time changes in brain function during exercise in healthy and clinical populations.},

  abstract = {One approach to understanding processes that underlie skilled performing has been to study electrical brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG). A notorious problem with EEG is that genuine cerebral data is often contaminated by artifacts of non-cerebral origin. Unfortunately, such artifacts tend to be exacerbated when the subject is in motion, meaning that obtaining reliable data during exercise is inherently problematic. These problems may explain the limited number of studies using EEG as a methodological tool in the sports sciences. This paper discusses how empirical studies have generally tackled the problem of movement artifact by adopting alternative paradigms which avoid recording during actual physical exertion. Moreover, the specific challenges that motion presents to obtaining reliable EEG data are discussed along with practical and computational techniques to confront these challenges. Finally, as EEG recording in sports is often underpinned by a desire to optimise performance, a brief review of EEG-biofeedback and peak performance studies is also presented. A knowledge of practical aspects of EEG recording along with the advent of new technology and increasingly sophisticated processing models offer a promising approach to minimising, if perhaps not entirely circumventing, the problem of obtaining reliable EEG data during motion.},

  abstract = {Neural circuits consist of many noisy, slow components, with individual neurons subject to ion channel noise, axonal propagation delays, and unreliable and slow synaptic transmission. This raises a fundamental question: how can reliable computation emerge from such unreliable components? A classic strategy is to simply average over a population of N weakly-coupled neurons to achieve errors that scale as 1 / N. But more interestingly, recent work has introduced networks of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons that achieve coding errors that scale superclassically as 1/N by combining the principles of predictive coding and fast and tight inhibitory-excitatory balance. However, spike transmission delays preclude such fast inhibition, and computational studies have observed that such delays can cause pathological synchronization that in turn destroys superclassical coding performance. Intriguingly, it has also been observed in simulations that noise can actually improve coding performance, and that there exists some optimal level of noise that minimizes coding error. However, we lack a quantitative theory that describes this fascinating interplay between delays, noise and neural coding performance in spiking networks. In this work, we elucidate the mechanisms underpinning this beneficial role of noise by deriving analytical expressions for coding error as a function of spike propagation delay and noise levels in predictive coding tight-balance networks of LIF neurons. Furthermore, we compute the minimal coding error and the associated optimal noise level, finding that they grow as power-laws with the delay. Our analysis reveals quantitatively how optimal levels of noise can rescue neural coding performance in spiking neural networks with delays by preventing the build up of pathological synchrony without overwhelming the overall spiking dynamics. This analysis can serve as a foundation for the further study of precise computation in the presence of noise and delays in efficient spiking neural circuits.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The inertial flywheel device causes an increase in eccentric overload during training. The aim was to study muscle oxygen saturation produced during an inertial flywheel squat training, comparing it with a barbell squat training. METHODS Twelve male adults performed a barbell squat training (3\texttimes 8 reps, 75-80\% 1RM) and a flywheel squat training (3\texttimes 8 reps, all-out). Muscle oxygen saturation (\%SmO2), total hemoglobin (tHb), reoxygenation, heart rate (HR), lactate, vertical jumps, maximal voluntary isometric contraction and rated perceived exertion (RPE) were studied. RESULTS Both protocols produced a significant decrease in \%SmO2 and tHB during the sets of squats, and a significant increase in HR, lactates dand RPE after training. The flywheel squat protocol caused a greater decrease in \%SmO2 than the barbell squat protocol in each of the sets of exercises (1st set: -67.5{$\pm$}7.2\% vs. -53.7{$\pm$}16.2\%; 2nd set: -67.2{$\pm$}13.5\% vs. -53.6{$\pm$}15.4\%; 3rd set: -68.1{$\pm$}13.0\% vs. -55.0{$\pm$}17.0\%), as well as a longer reoxygenation after finishing the training (61.7{$\pm$}12.6 vs. 55.7{$\pm$}13.7 s). CONCLUSIONS Although no differences were found on a muscle fatigue level, the flywheel training brought on greater physiological stress than the barbell squat training, observing a greater decrease in muscle oxygen saturation and a longer reoxygenation.},

Complex muscle activation patterns characterizing postural responses suggest the need for independent muscle control. However, our previous work shows that postural responses in cats can be robustly reproduced by the activation of a few muscle synergies. We now investigate whether a similar neural strategy is used for human postural control. We hypothesized that a few muscle synergies could account for the intertrial variability in automatic postural responses from different perturbation directions, as well as different postural strategies. Postural responses to multidirectional support-surface translations in 16 muscles of the lower back and leg were analyzed in nine healthy subjects. Six or fewer muscle synergies were required to reproduce the postural responses of each subject. The composition and temporal activation of several muscle synergies identified across all subjects were consistent with the previously identified ``ankle'' and ``hip'' strategies in human postural responses. Moreover, intertrial variability in muscle activation patterns was successfully reproduced by modulating the activity of the various muscle synergies. This suggests that trial-to-trial variations in the activation of individual muscles are correlated and, moreover, represent variations in the amplitude of descending neural commands that activate individual muscle synergies. Finally, composition and temporal activation of most of the muscle synergies were similar across subjects. These results suggest that muscle synergies represent a general neural strategy underlying muscle coordination in postural tasks.},

Fourteen men performed a set to failure with maximum intended velocity, against low (40\%-1 repetition maximum-RM), moderate (60\%-1RM), and heavy loads (80\%-1RM). Number of repetitions, volume load, mean and peak velocity, and total time increased with decreasing load (40\% {$>$} 60\% {$>$} 80\%, p {$<$} 0.01). sEMG comparisons between different loads were performed by matching time under tension at the initial, middle, and last part of the set. sEMG was higher in the middle and last repetitions, compared with the initial, for all loads in both muscles (p {$<$} 0.001). sEMG activity of both muscles was higher in the 60\% and 80\%-1RM conditions compared with the 40\%1-RM (p {$<$} 0.007). Also, sEMG of both muscles was similar for the 60\%-1RM and 80\%-1RM loads at the initial, middle, and last repetitions, with the exception of the last repetitions for the TB muscle. In contrast, sEMG integrated activity was higher for the 40\% 1-RM and 60\% 1-RM (p {$<$} 0.01) compared with the 80\% 1-RM load. Mean velocity loss at exhaustion and drop in sEMG median frequency were greater in the 40\% and 60\%-1RM compared with the 80\%-1RM condition (p {$<$} 0.05). It was concluded that performing a set to exhaustion with maximum intended velocity using a load of 60\% 1-RM combines the characteristics of the high average sEMG activity of heavier loads, and the high total integrated sEMG observed at lighter loads.},

Simultaneously cortical electroencephalography (EEG) activities and electromyography (EMG) activities that are activated by phasic voluntary movements are recorded for 10 healthy young person and relation of the coherence between the signals are observed in time frequency domain. There is a decreasing significant coherence activity in third fatigue stage against to first and second fatigue stages.

To investigate the muscle dependency of the corticomuscular coherence and its training-related alterations, we quantified the coherence between electroencephalogram (EEG) from the sensorimotor cortex and rectified electromyogram (EMG) from five upper limb (first dorsal interosseous, flexor carpi radialis, extensor carpi radialis, biceps brachii, triceps brachii) and four lower limb muscles (soleus, tibialis anterior, biceps femoris, rectus femoris), while maintaining a constant force level at 30\% of maximal voluntary contraction of each muscle, in 24 untrained, 12 skill-trained (ballet dancers), and 10 strength-trained (weightlifters) individuals. Data from untrained subjects demonstrated the muscle dependency of corticomuscular coherence. The magnitude of the EEG-EMG coherence was significantly greater in the distally located lower limb muscles, such as the soleus and tibialis anterior, than in the upper or other lower limb muscles in untrained subjects (P {$<$} 0.05). These results imply that oscillatory coupling between the sensorimotor cortex and spinal motoneurons during steady contraction differs among muscles, according to the functional role of each muscle. In addition, the ballet dancers and weightlifters showed smaller EEG-EMG coherences than the untrained subjects, especially in the lower limb muscles (P {$<$} 0.05). These results indicate that oscillatory interaction between the sensorimotor cortex and spinal motoneurons can be changed by long-term specialized use of the muscles and that this neural adaptation may lead to finer control of muscle force during steady contraction.},

  abstract = {1. Slow finger movements were analysed in normal human subjects with regard to kinematics and EMG activity of the long finger muscles. Surface EMG from the finger extensor and flexor muscles on the forearm was recorded along with angular position and angular velocity during voluntary ramp movements at single metacarpophalangeal joints. Angular acceleration was computed from the velocity record. 2. It was found that movements were not smooth but characterized by steps or discontinuities, often recurring at intervals of 100-125 ms, yielding velocity and acceleration profiles dominated by 8-10 Hz cycles. The discontinuities were manifest from the very first trial and thus not dependent on training. Their amplitude and amount varied between subjects but were relatively stable for the individual subject. 3. The 8-10 Hz cycles were seen with voluntary ramp movements of widely varying velocities, higher velocities being associated with larger steps recurring with the same repetition rate as the small steps of slow voluntary ramps. Maximal step amplitude observed was more than one order of magnitude larger than physiological tremor. 4. The individual 8-10 Hz cycle was asymmetrical in that decelerations usually reached higher peaks than the preceding acceleration, suggesting that the antagonist contributed with a braking action. Moreover, in very slow voluntary ramps, the movement cycles were often interspaced by periods of zero velocity, providing a highly non-sinusoidal velocity profile. 5. The EMG of the agonist and the antagonist muscles was modulated in close relation to the accelerations and decelerations respectively of the individual movement cycle. These modulations were present in both extensor and flexor muscles, although they were more consistent and usually more prominent in the former. 6. The findings indicate that a feature of slow finger movements was an 8-10 Hz periodic output to the muscular system, suggesting that slow finger movements are implemented by a series of biphasic force pulses, involving not only the shortening agonist muscle propelling the movement, but the antagonist muscle as well whose activity increased shortly after the agonist and contributed to a sharp deceleration of the individual step of movement. 7. It is proposed, as a hypothesis, that this biphasic motor output may reflect a similar organization of the descending motor command for slow finger movements. Hence, this command would include a series of biphasic pulses, concatenated at a rate of 8-10 per second and a pulse-height regulator capable of setting the size of the pulse and thus the overall speed of the movement.},

FBF was derived from 1) NIRS and 2) strain-gauge plethysmography. Twenty-six healthy subjects were tested at rest and during sustained isometric handgrip exercise. Local variations were investigated with two independent and simultaneously operating NIRS systems at two different muscles and two measurement depths. muscV(O(2)) increased more than fivefold in the active flexor digitorum superficialis muscle, and it increased 1.6 times in the brachioradialis muscle. The average increase in muscV(O(2(Fick))) was twofold. FBF increased 1.4 times independent of the muscle or the method. It is concluded that NIRS is an appropriate tool to provide information about local muscV(O(2)) and local FBF because both place and depth of the NIRS measurements reveal local differences that are not detectable by the more established, but also more global, Fick method.},

In the initial visits (1st and 2nd visits), participants performed a 1RM test to determine the load in the back-squat exercise. Following the two initials visits, participants attended the lab for the two experimental conditions (anodal tDCS and sham), which were completed a week apart, with sessions randomly counterbalanced. The stimulation was applied over the DLPFC for 20~minutes using a 2~mA current intensity. Immediately after the experimental conditions, participants completed three sets of maximum repetitions (80\% of 1RM), with a 1-minute recovery interval between each set in the back-squat exercise. Muscle endurance was determined by the total number of repetitions and the number of repetitions in each set. Results: The total number of repetitions was higher in the anodal tDCS condition compared to sham condition (p {$\leq$} .0001). Moreover, the number of repetitions performed in the first set was higher for anodal tDCS condition than in the sham condition (p {$\leq$} .01). Conclusion: This study found improvement in back-squat exercise performance after the application of anodal tDCS.

Methods: eight professional cyclists participated in this study. Each subject performed 60-second all-out cycling exercise for one time and the sEMG of RF was recorded during the process. The braking torque imposed on cycling motion was 8\% of each subject's weight. Combined with time-domain, flourier transform, wavelet packet transformation and nonlinear analysis method, RMS, MPF, MNF and nonlinear Lempel-Ziv complexity C(n) were calculated. Sensitivity and stability of each index in evaluating muscle fatigue of RF caused by all-out cycling exercise was compared and analyzed. Results: MPF?MNF and C(n) all decreased during muscle fatigue, having significant negative correlations with cycling exercise endurance time and significant positive correlations with pedaling rate and power output. MNF was found to have the highest fatigue sensitivity while RMS had the lowest fatigue sensitivity. The sensitivity of MPF and C(n) had no significant difference. As refer to stability, C(n) was the optimum index and MNF the second, followed by MPF and RMS. Conclusions: During all-out cycling exercise process, RF did vigorous dynamic contraction, making sEMG collected from the surface of RF nonlinear and non-stationary. The index of MNF based on wavelet packet transformation and the index of Lempel-Ziv complexity C(n) based on nonlinear analysis demonstrated high utility, suggesting the potential application of these methods as fatigue indices in evaluating muscle fatigue caused by all-out cycling exercise.},

There are many function-specific explanations for the necessity of inhibitory connections, including to balance excitatory connections, memorize, decide, and avoid seizures. We propose an answer from the perspective of representation capacity. We believe representing functions is the primary role of both (i) the brain in natural intelligence, and (ii) deep networks in artificial intelligence. Our answer to why there are inhibitory/negative weights is: to learn more functions. We prove that, in the absence of negative weights, neural networks are not universal approximators. While this may be an intuitive result, to the best of our knowledge, there is no formal theory, in either machine learning or neuroscience, that demonstrates why negative weights are crucial in the context of representation capacity. Further, we provide insights on the geometric properties of the representation space that non-negative deep networks cannot represent. We expect these insights will yield a deeper understanding of more sophisticated inductive priors imposed on the distribution of weights that lead to more efficient biological and machine learning.},

Results: Set MV and power output were substantially higher in the 10\% protocol (0.66 m{$\cdot$}s-1 and 1341 W, respectively), followed by the 20\% (0.62 m{$\cdot$}s-1 and 1246 W) and 30\% protocols (0.59 m{$\cdot$}s-1 and 1179 W). There were no substantial changes in MV (-0.01 to -0.02 m{$\cdot$}s-1) or power output (-14 to -55 W) across the 5 sets for all protocols, and individual differences in these changes were typically trivial to small. Mean set repetitions were substantially higher in the 30\% protocol (7.8), followed by the 20\% (6.4) and 10\% protocols (4.2). There were small to moderate reductions in repetitions across the 5 sets during all protocols (-39\%, -31\%, -19\%, respectively), and individual differences in these changes were small to very large. Conclusions: Velocity training prescription maintains kinetic and kinematic output across multiple sets of the back squat, with repetition ranges being highly variable. Our findings, therefore, challenge traditional resistance training paradigms (repetition based) and add support to a velocity-based approach.},

  abstract = {Aim Paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to investigate the influence of 4 weeks of heavy load squat strength training on corticospinal excitability and short-interval intracortical inhibition (rectus femoris muscle). Methods Participants (n = 12) were randomly allocated to a strength training or control group. The strength training group completed 4 weeks of heavy load squat strength training. Recruitment curves were constructed to determine values for the slope of the curve, V50 and peak height. Short-interval intracortical inhibition was assessed using a subthreshold (0.7 \texttimes{} active motor threshold) conditioning stimulus, followed 3 ms later by a supra-threshold (1.2 \texttimes{} active motor threshold) test stimulus. All motor evoked responses were taken during 10\% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC) torque and normalized to the maximal M-wave. Results The strength training group attained 87\% increases in 1RM squat strength (P {$<$} 0.01), significant increases in measures of corticospinal excitability (1.2 \texttimes{} Motor threshold: 116\%, P = 0.016; peak height of recruitment curve = 105\%, P {$<$} 0.001), and a 32\% reduction in short-interval intracortical inhibition (P {$<$} 0.01) following the 4-week intervention compared with control. There were no changes in any dependent variable (P {$>$} 0.05) detected in the control group. Conclusion Repeated high force voluntary muscle activation in the form of short-term strength training reduces short-interval intracortical inhibition. This is consistent with studies involving skilled/complex tasks or novel movement patterns and acute studies investigating acute voluntary contractions.},

In the present study, we investigated cortical activity during lower limb movement using EEG. Assisted by a dynamic tilt table, all subjects performed standardized stepping movements in an upright position. Source localization of the movement-related potential in relation to spontaneous EEG showed activity in brain regions classically associated with human gait such as the primary motor cortex, the premotor cortex, the supplementary motor cortex, the cingulate cortex, the primary somatosensory cortex and the somatosensory association cortex. Further, we observed a task-related power decrease in the alpha and beta frequency band at electrodes overlying the leg motor area. A temporal activation and deactivation of the involved brain regions as well as the chronological sequence of the movement-related potential could be mapped to specific phases of the gait-like leg movement. We showed that most cortical capacity is needed for changing the direction between the flexion and extension phase. An enhanced understanding of the human gait will provide a basis to improve applications in the field of neurorehabilitation and brain\textendash computer interfaces.},

These tasks can vary both in the presence or absence of a pacing stimulus as well as in the complexity of the tapping task. A voxel-wise, coordinate-based meta-analysis was performed on 685 sets of activation foci in Talairach space gathered from 38 published studies employing finger-tapping tasks. Clusters of concordance were identified within the primary sensorimotor cortices, supplementary motor area, premotor cortex, inferior parietal cortices, basal ganglia, and anterior cerebellum. Subsequent analyses performed on subsets of the primary set of foci demonstrated that the use of a pacing stimulus resulted in a larger, more diverse network of concordance clusters, in comparison to varying the complexity of the tapping task. The majority of the additional concordance clusters occurred in regions involved in the temporal aspects of the tapping task, rather than its execution. Tapping tasks employing a visual pacing stimulus recruited a set of nodes distinct from the results observed in those tasks employing either an auditory or no pacing stimulus, suggesting differing cognitive networks when integrating visual or auditory pacing stimuli into simple motor tasks. The relatively uniform network of concordance clusters observed across the more complex finger-tapping tasks suggests that further complexity, beyond the use of multi-finger sequences or bimanual tasks, may be required to fully reveal those brain regions necessary to execute truly complex movements.},

The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of the studies that show effects of velocity-based resistance training on strength and power performance in elite athletes. Electronic searches of computerized databases were performed according to a protocol that was agreed by all co-authors. Four databases\textemdash SportDiscus with Full Text and MEDLINE via EBSCO, SCOPUS, and Web of Science\textemdash were searched. Seven studies were found which researched the effects of velocity-based resistance training on athletes after a given training period. The analyzed studies suggest that applying velocity losses of 10\textendash 20\% can help induce neuromuscular adaptations and reduce neuromuscular fatigue. Using velocity zones as part of a separate or combined (e.g., plyometric) training program can elicit adaptations in body composition and performance parameters. Moreover, velocity zones can be programmed using a periodized or non-periodized fixed velocity zones protocol. Lastly, obtaining instantaneous feedback during training is a more effective tool for increasing performance in sport-specific parameters, and should be used by sport practitioners to help keep athletes accountable for their performance.},

  abstract = {One of the newest frontiers of physical therapy is the field of epigenetics, which examines how pervasive environmental factors such as exercise regulate the expression of genes. The epigenome may be one of the most powerful systems through which exercise exerts its beneficial effects on health and longevity. Large epidemiology studies show that individuals who regularly exercise demonstrate a lower ``epigenetic age,'' experience fewer metabolic diseases, and enjoy greater longevity. However, the dose, mode, intensity, and duration of exercise required to achieve a healthy epigenetic profile is unknown. As experts in exercise prescription, physical therapists are ideally suited to contribute to the discovery of this dose-response relationship. This perspective makes a case for the genesis of ``precision physical therapy,'' which capitalizes on epigenetic discoveries to optimize exercise-based interventions. Summarized here is the emerging body of knowledge supporting epigenetic adaptations to exercise in humans, including the intriguing possibility that these environmentally modified traits could be passed down to offspring. In the future, it is likely that epigenetic data will enhance our understanding of individual disease risk and individual response to prescribed exercise. The profession of physical therapy must be alert to new epigenetic knowledge that can enhance the specificity and efficacy of movement-based treatments.},

Method A computerized search of Web of Science, PsycINFO and PubMed was performed to identify relevant studies, published 1990 through February 1, 2017. The outcome measures were sport performance and EEG power. Two review authors identified eligible studies and extracted data independently. The quality of the included studies was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Standard mean differences (SMDs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and pooled using a random effects model. Results A total of 10 randomized controlled trials (229 athletes) met the inclusion criteria. Significant effects of NFT were found for sport performance (SMD = 0.65, 95\%CI\,=\,0.28 to 1.03, p = .0006) and EEG power (SMD\,=\,0.45, 95\%CI\,=\,0.09 to 0.80, p = .01). However, the NFT's effect for sport performance was not significantly different when compared to well-controlled trials with active/placebo control (SMD\,=\,0.51, 95\% CI\,=\,-0.27 to 1.30, p = .20). Conclusions NFT could make athletes change in EEG power and effectively improve sport performance. Effect of NFT for sport performance was moderated by control group design, that is, when analyses were restricted to active/placebo controls, the efficacy NFT applied in sport performance might be rather weak. Future efforts should focus on standard NFT protocols and better-organized trials.},

As optically measured hemoglobin signals strongly correlate with BOLD signals, simultaneous measurement using NIRS and fMRI promises a significant mutual enhancement of temporal and spatial resolutions. Although there exists a powerful statistical parametric mapping tool in fMRI, current public domain statistical tools for NIRS have several limitations related to the quantitative analysis of simultaneous recording studies with fMRI. In this paper, a new public domain statistical toolbox known as NIRS-SPM is described. It enables the quantitative analysis of NIRS signal. More specifically, NIRS data are statistically analyzed based on the general linear model (GLM) and Sun's tube formula. The p-values are calculated as the excursion probability of an inhomogeneous random field on a representation manifold that is dependent on the structure of the error covariance matrix and the interpolating kernels. NIRS-SPM not only enables the calculation of activation maps of oxy-, deoxy-hemoglobin and total hemoglobin, but also allows for the super-resolution localization, which is not possible using conventional analysis tools. Extensive experimental results using finger tapping and memory tasks confirm the viability of the proposed method.},

Although significant corticomuscular connectivity during walking has been reported, the level at which the cortical activity is involved in muscle activity (muscle synergy or individual muscle level) remains unclear. Here we examined cortical correlates of muscle activation during walking by brain decoding of activation of muscle synergies and individual muscles from electroencephalographic signals. We demonstrated that the activation of locomotor muscle synergies was decoded from slow~cortical waves. In addition, the decoding accuracy for muscle synergies was greater than that for individual muscles and the decoding of individual muscle activation was based on muscle-synergy-related cortical information. These results indicate the cortical correlates of locomotor muscle synergy activation. These findings expand our understanding of the relationships between brain and locomotor muscle synergies and could accelerate the development of effective brain-machine interfaces for walking rehabilitation.},

To this end, our neuroimaging meta-analysis included 20 studies and investigated the influence of physical exercise on cognition-related functional brain activation. The overall meta-analysis encompassing all experiments revealed physical exercise-induced changes in the left parietal lobe during cognitive processing. Subgroup analysis further revealed that in the younger-age group ({$<$} 35 years old) physical exercise induced more widespread changes in the right hemisphere, whereas in the older-age group ({$\geq$} 35 years old) exercise-induced changes were restricted to the left parietal lobe. Subgroup analysis for intervention duration showed that shorter exercise interventions induced changes in regions connected with frontoparietal and default mode networks, whereas regions exhibiting effects of longer interventions connected with frontoparietal and dorsal attention networks.

  abstract = {The application of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in the neurosciences has been expanding over the last 40 years. Today, it is addressing a wide range of applications within different populations and utilizes a great variety of experimental paradigms. With the rapid growth and the diversification of research methods, some inconsistencies are appearing in the way in which methods are presented, which can make the interpretation and replication of studies unnecessarily challenging. The Society for Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy has thus been motivated to organize a representative (but not exhaustive) group of leaders in the field to build a consensus on the best practices for describing the methods utilized in fNIRS studies. Our paper has been designed to provide guidelines to help enhance the reliability, repeatability, and traceability of reported fNIRS studies and encourage best practices throughout the community. A checklist is provided to guide authors in the preparation of their manuscripts and to assist reviewers when evaluating fNIRS papers.},

Most practical fatigue assessments rely on subjective measurement scales including surveys and questionnaires. While they have the advantage of being inexpensive to implement, they lack reliability. Objective assessments of physical exertion and fatigue that are based on physiological processes are more reliable, however they are cumbersome to implement on-site. The advent of low-cost, wearable motion sensors has made high-frequency sampling of kinematic data possible. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of using jerk, the time derivative of acceleration, as an indicator of physical exertion as fatigue develops over the course of a demanding task. As a proof-of-concept, the method was first tested on participants completing a repetitive physically demanding exercise. The method was then demonstrated in a study of masonry work done by bricklayers with varying levels of masonry experience. We conclude that jerk is a useful indicator of physical exertion and experience level.},

Relatively accurate characterizations of normal and impaired gait features were attained at the kinematic and muscular levels. Conversely, the neural processes underlying gait dynamics still need to be elucidated. To shed light on gait-related modulations of neural activity, we collected high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) signals and ankle acceleration data in young healthy participants during treadmill walking. We used the ankle acceleration data to segment each gait cycle in four phases: initial double support, right leg swing, final double support, left leg swing. Then, we processed hdEEG signals to extract neural oscillations in alpha, beta, and gamma bands, and examined event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) across gait phases. Our results showed that ERD/ERS modulations for alpha, beta, and gamma bands were strongest in the primary sensorimotor cortex (M1), but were also found in premotor cortex, thalamus and cerebellum. We observed a modulation of neural oscillations across gait phases in M1 and cerebellum, and an interaction between frequency band and gait phase in premotor cortex and thalamus. Furthermore, an ERD/ERS lateralization effect was present in M1 for the alpha and beta bands, and in the cerebellum for the beta and gamma bands. Overall, our findings demonstrate that an electrophysiological source imaging approach based on hdEEG can be used to investigate dynamic neural processes of gait control. Future work on the development of mobile hdEEG-based brain-body imaging platforms may enable overground walking investigations, with potential applications in the study of gait disorders.},

Also, a growing number of stimulation methods have emerged to modulate and influence brain activity. Current brain-computer interface (BCI) technology is mainly on therapeutic outcomes, it already demonstrated its efficiency as assistive and rehabilitative technology for patients with severe motor impairments. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies have been used to decode brain signals. Beyond this progress, combining AI with advanced BCIs in the form of implantable neurotechnologies grants new possibilities for the diagnosis, prediction, and treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. In this context, we envision the development of closed loop, intelligent, low-power, and miniaturized neural interfaces that will use brain inspired AI techniques with neuromorphic hardware to process the data from the brain. This will be referred to as Brain Inspired Brain Computer Interfaces (BI-BCIs). Such neural interfaces would offer access to deeper brain regions and better understanding for brain's functions and working mechanism, which improves BCIs operative stability and system's efficiency. On one hand, brain inspired AI algorithms represented by spiking neural networks (SNNs) would be used to interpret the multimodal neural signals in the BCI system. On the other hand, due to the ability of SNNs to capture rich dynamics of biological neurons and to represent and integrate different information dimensions such as time, frequency, and phase, it would be used to model and encode complex information processing in the brain and to provide feedback to the users. This paper provides an overview of the different methods to interface with the brain, presents future applications and discusses the merger of AI and BCIs.},

  abstract = {Intracortical inhibition in motor cortex (M1) regulates movement and motor learning. If cortical and thalamic inputs target different inhibitory cell types in different layers, then these afferents may play different roles in regulating M1 output. Using mice of both sexes, we quantified input to two main classes of M1 interneurons, parvalbumin+ (PV+) cells and somatostatin+ (SOM+) cells, using monosynaptic rabies tracing. We then compared anatomic and functional connectivity based on synaptic strength from sensory cortex and thalamus. Functionally, each input innervated M1 interneurons with a unique laminar profile. Different interneuron types were excited in a distinct, complementary manner, suggesting feedforward inhibition proceeds selectively via distinct circuits. Specifically, somatosensory cortex (S1) inputs primarily targeted PV+ neurons in upper layers (L2/3) but SOM+ neurons in middle layers (L5). Somatosensory thalamus [posterior nucleus (PO)] inputs targeted PV+ neurons in middle layers (L5). In contrast to sensory cortical areas, thalamic input to SOM+ neurons was equivalent to that of PV+ neurons. Thus, long-range excitatory inputs target inhibitory neurons in an area and a cell type-specific manner, which contrasts with input to neighboring pyramidal cells. In contrast to feedforward inhibition providing generic inhibitory tone in cortex, circuits are selectively organized to recruit inhibition matched to incoming excitatory circuits.    SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT   M1 integrates sensory information and frontal cortical inputs to plan and control movements. Although inputs to excitatory cells are described, the synaptic circuits by which these inputs drive specific types of M1 interneurons are unknown. Anatomical results with rabies tracing and physiological quantification of synaptic strength shows that two main classes of inhibitory cells (PV+ and SOM+ interneurons) both receive substantial cortical and thalamic input, in contrast to interneurons in sensory areas (where thalamic input strongly prefers PV+ interneurons). Further, each input studied targets PV+ and SOM+ interneurons in a different fashion, suggesting that separate, specific circuits exist for recruitment of feedforward inhibition.},

These and other properties are consequences of the complexity resulting from nonlinear dynamic networks collectively summarized for biomedical phenomena as the Network Effect (NE) or focused more narrowly as Network Physiology. Herein we address the measurable consequences of the NE on time series generated by different parts of the brain, heart, and lung organ networks, which are directly related to their inter-network and intra-network interactions. Moreover, these same physiologic organ networks have been shown to generate crucial event (CE) time series, and herein are shown, using modified diffusion entropy analysis (MDEA), to have scaling indices with quasiperiodic changes in complexity, as measured by scaling indices, over time. Such time series are generated by different parts of the brain, heart, and lung organ networks, and the results do not depend on the underlying coherence properties of the associated time series but demonstrate a generalized synchronization of complexity. This high order synchrony among the scaling indices of EEG (brain), ECG (heart), and respiratory time series is governed by the quantitative interdependence of the multifractal behavior of the various physiological organs' network dynamics. This consequence of the NE opens the door for an entirely general characterization of the dynamics of complex networks in terms of complexity synchronization (CS) independently of the scientific, engineering, or technological context.},

To investigate this issue, we manipulated the presence of manual actions and sentence context, assessing the level of corticospinal excitability by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation. We hypothesized that context would serve to sharpen the neural representation of the described actions in the motor cortex, reflected in context-specific modulation of corticospinal excitability.  Participants silently read manual action verbs and non-manual verbs, preceded by a full sentence (rich context) or not (minimal context). Transcranial magnetic stimulation pulses were delivered at rest or shortly after verb presentation. The coil was positioned over the cortical representation of the right first dorsal interosseous (pointer finger).  We observed a general increase of corticospinal excitability while reading both manual action and non-manual verbs in minimal context, whereas the modulation was action-specific in rich context: corticospinal excitability increased while reading manual verbs, but did not differ from baseline for non-manual verbs. These findings suggest that sentence context sharpens motor representations, activating the motor cortex when relevant and eliminating any residual motor activation when no action is present.},

  journal = {bioRxiv Bioengineering},
  doi = {10.1101/2022.11.02.514949},
  abstract = {The movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) is a low-frequency component of the electroencephalography (EEG) signal recorded from the motor cortex and its neighboring cortical areas. Since the MRCP encodes motor intention and execution, it may be utilized as an interface between patients and neurorehabilitation technologies. This study investigates the EEG signal recorded from the Cz electrode to discriminate between four levels of rate of force development (RFD) of the tibialis anterior muscle. For classification, three feature sets were evaluated to describe the EEG traces. These were (i) MRCP morphological characteristics in the delta-band such as amplitude and timing, (ii) MRCP statistical characteristics in the delta-band such as mean, standard deviation, and kurtosis, and (iii) wideband time-frequency features in the 0.5-90 Hz range. Using a support vector machine for classification, the four levels of RFD were classified with a mean (SD) accuracy of 82\% (7\%) accuracy when using the time-frequency feature space, and with an accuracy of 75\% (12\%) when using the MRCP statistical characteristics. It was also observed that some of the key features from the statistical and morphological sets responded monotonically to the intensity of the RFD. Examples are slope and standard deviation in the (0, 1)s window for the statistical, and  and  for the morphological sets. This monotonical response of features explains the observed performance of the delta-band MRCP and corresponding high discriminative power. Results from temporal analysis considering the pre-movement phase ((-3, 0)s) and three windows of the post-movement phase ((0, 1)s, (1, 2)s, and (2, 3)s)) suggest that the complete MRCP waveform represents high information content regarding the planning, execution, duration, and ending of the isometric dorsiflexion task using the tibialis anterior muscle. Results shed light on the role of delta-band in translating to motor command, with potential applications in neural engineering systems.},

  doi = {10.1113/JP282564},
  abstract = {Key points The capacity of motor cortical systems to drive voluntary motoneuronal output changes during fatiguing exercise and thus influences the development of central fatigue and performance. It is too simplistic to conclude that decreases in motor cortical or motoneuronal excitability may contribute to central fatigue and impaired performance as some studies show increased corticomotoneuronal excitability in some exercise modalities. Endogenous forms of neuromodulation, such as serotonin released from neurones, can alter central fatigue and motoneuronal output. Exogenous forms of neuromodulation, such as non-invasive brain stimulation, may also do this, but current evidence is not convincing. Further well-controlled studies and replications are needed to expose the cause-and-effect relationship between brain responsiveness and exercise performance Neural drive originating in higher brain areas reaches exercising limb muscles through the corticospinal-motoneuronal pathway which links the motor cortex and spinal motoneurones. The properties of this pathway have frequently been observed to change during fatiguing exercise in ways that could influence the development of central fatigue, i.e. the progressive reduction in voluntary muscle activation. However, based on differences in motor cortical and motoneuronal excitability between exercise modalities (e.g. single-joint vs locomotor exercise), there is no characteristic response that allows for a categorical conclusion about the effect of these changes on functional impairments and performance limitations. Despite the lack of uniformity in findings during fatigue, there is strong evidence for marked 'inhibition' of motoneurones as a direct result of voluntary drive. Endogenous forms of neuromodulation, such as via serotonin released from neurones, can directly affect motoneuronal output and central fatigue. Exogenous forms of neuromodulation, such as brain stimulation, may achieve a similar effect, but the evidence is weak. Non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation can cause transient or long-lasting changes in cortical excitability, however, variable results across studies cast doubt on its claimed capacity to enhance performance. Furthermore, with these studies it is difficult to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between brain responsiveness and exercise performance. This review briefly summarises changes in the corticomotoneuronal pathway during various types of exercise, considers the relevance of these changes for the development of central fatigue, and the potential of non-invasive brain stimulation to enhance motor cortical excitability, motoneuronal output, and, ultimately, exercise performance.  figure legend  Figure illustrating main components of the corticospinal-motoneuronal pathway and factors influencing its properties, and potentially performance, during fatiguing exercise.

  abstract = {Walking and running are based on rapid burst-like muscle contractions. Burst-like contractions generate a Gaussian-shaped force profile, in which neuromuscular determinants have never been assessed. We investigated the neural and contractile determinants of the rate of force development (RFD) in burst-like isometric knee extensions. Together with maximal voluntary force (MVF), voluntary and electrically evoked (8 stimuli at 300 Hz, octets) forces were measured in the first 50, 100 and 150 ms of burst-like quadriceps contractions in 24 adults. High-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) was adopted to measure the root mean square (RMS) and muscle fiber conduction velocity (MFCV) from the vastus lateralis and medialis. The determinants of voluntary force at 50, 100 and 150 ms were assessd by stepwise multiple regression analysis. Force at 50 ms was explained by RMS (R2 =\,0.361); force at 100 ms was explained by octet (R2 =\,0.646); force at 150 ms was explained by MVF (R2 =\,0.711) and octet (R2 =\,0.061). Peak RFD (which occurred at 60 {$\pm$}\,10 ms from contraction onset) was explained by MVF (R2 =\,0.518) and by RMS50 (R2 =\,0.074). MFCV did not emerge as a determinant of RFD. Muscle excitation was the sole determinant of early RFD (50 ms), while contractile characteristics were more relevant for late RFD ({$\geq$}100 ms). As peak RFD is mostly determined by MVF, it may not be more informative than MVF itself. Therefore, a time-locked analysis of RFD provides more insights into the neuromuscular characteristics of explosive contractions.},

  journal = {Brain Stimulation},
  doi = {10.1016/j.brs.2022.10.001},
  abstract = {Introduction  There is currently a gap in accessibility to neuromodulation tools that can approximate the efficacy and spatial resolution of invasive methods. Low intensity transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is an emerging technology for non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) that can penetrate cortical and deep brain structures with more focal stimulation compared to existing NIBS modalities. Theta burst TUS (tbTUS, TUS delivered in a theta burst pattern) is a novel repetitive TUS protocol that can induce durable changes in motor cortex excitability, thereby holding promise as a novel neuromodulation tool with durable effects.  Objective  The aim of the present study was to elucidate the neurophysiologic effects of tbTUS motor cortical excitability, as well on local and global neural oscillations and network connectivity.  Methods  An 80-second train of active or sham tbTUS was delivered to the left motor cortex in 15 healthy subjects. Motor cortical excitability was investigated through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-elicited motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF) using paired-pulse TMS. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings during resting state and an index finger abduction-adduction task were used to assess oscillatory brain responses and network connectivity. The correlations between the changes in neural oscillations and motor cortical excitability were also evaluated.  Results  tbTUS to the motor cortex results in a sustained increase in MEP amplitude and decreased SICI, but no change in ICF. MEG spectral power analysis revealed TUS-mediated desynchronization in alpha and beta spectral power. Significant changes in alpha power were detected within the supplementary motor cortex (Right\,{$>$}\,Left) and changes in beta power within bilateral supplementary motor cortices, right basal ganglia and parietal regions. Coherence analysis revealed increased local connectivity in motor areas. MEP and SICI changes correlated with both local and inter-regional coherence.  Conclusion  The findings from this study provide novel insights into the neurophysiologic basis of TUS-mediated neuroplasticity and point to the involvement of regions within the motor network in mediating this sustained response. Future studies may further characterize the durability of TUS-mediated neuroplasticity and its clinical applications as a neuromodulation strategy for neurological and psychiatric disorders.},

  doi = {10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1062-22.2022},
  abstract = {Forelimb-related areas of the motor cortex communicate directly to downstream areas in the brainstem and spinal cord via axons that project to and through the pyramidal tract (PT). To better understand the diversity of the brainstem branching patterns of these pyramidal tract projections, we used MAPseq, a molecular barcode technique for population-scale sampling with single-axon resolution. In experiments using mice of both sexes, we first confirmed prior results demonstrating the basic efficacy of axonal barcode identification of primary motor cortex (M1) PT-type axons, including corticobulbar (CBULB) and corticospinal (CSPI) subclasses. We then used multiplexed MAPseq to analyze projections from M1 and M2 (caudal and rostral forelimb areas). The four basic axon subclasses comprising these projections (M1-CSPI, M1-CBULB, M2-CSPI, M2-CBULB) showed a complex mix of differences and similarities in their brainstem projection profiles. This included relatively abundant branching by all classes in the dorsal midbrain, by M2 subclasses in the pons, and by CSPI subclasses in the dorsal medulla. Cluster analysis showed graded distributions of the basic subclasses within the PT class. Clusters were of diversely mixed subclass composition and showed distinct rostrocaudal and/or dorsomedial projection biases. Exemplifying these patterns was a subcluster likely enriched in corticocuneate branches. Overall, the results indicate high yet systematic PT axon diversity at the level of brainstem branching patterns; projections of M1 and M2 appear qualitatively similar, yet with quantitative differences in subclasses and clusters.    SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT   Axons of the PT class of cortical projection neurons, which includes corticospinal and corticobulbar neurons, anatomically link motor cortex to brainstem and spinal cord circuits. Both of these subclasses can form branches to brainstem destinations along the way, but the extent and diversity of these branching patterns is incompletely understood. Here, we used MAPseq to tag PT axons with individual molecular barcodes for high-throughput quantification of branching patterns across the brainstem. The results reveal diverse, complex, yet systematic branching patterns of corticospinal and corticobulbar neurons arising from two motor cortex areas, M1 and M2.},

Quantitative analysis indicates that the suggestion system reduces personnel labor by at least 50\%. Moreover, our results show that larger training datasets with the same software architecture are unlikely to further improve performance without ad-hoc heuristics due to intrinsic ambiguities in neuroscience nomenclature. All components of this project are released open source for community enhancement and extensions to additional applications.},

  journal = {Cell Reports},
  doi = {10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111608},
  abstract = {A major issue in modern neuroscience is to understand how cell populations present multiple spatial and motor features during goal-directed movements. The direction and distance (depth) of arm movements often appear to be controlled independently during behavior, but it is unknown whether they share neural resources or not. Using information theory, singular value decomposition, and dimensionality reduction methods, we compare direction and depth effects and their convergence across three parietal areas during an arm movement task. All methods show a stronger direction effect during early movement preparation, whereas depth signals prevail during movement execution. Going from anterior to posterior sectors, we report an increased number of cells processing both signals and stronger depth effects. These findings suggest a serial direction and depth processing consistent with behavioral evidence and reveal a gradient of joint versus independent control of these features in parietal cortex that supports its role in sensorimotor transformations.   Introduction  An overarching aim of modern neuroscience is to understand how populations of cells across different parts of the nervous system interact in a dynamic manner, which allows the precise coordination of our perception and action. Like in other primates, a large proportion of what we do in our daily lives involves reaching with the arm and grasping objects located in the three-dimensional (3D) peripersonal space. Although every arm movement occurs in 3D space, it has become traditional among researchers to make a distinction between movement direction and amplitude or depth, i.e., how far the arm extends to reach its target. However, after over three decades of research, it is still under debate as to whether the brain specifies these two movement parameters independently. Numerous psychophysical and lesion studies suggest that reach coordinates are processed by separate neuronal channels (Soechting and Flanders, 1989  Soechting J.F.   Flanders M.

  journal = {Cell Reports},
  doi = {10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111627},
  abstract = {In rodent motor cortex, the rostral forelimb area (RFA) and the caudal forelimb area (CFA) are major actors in orchestrating the control of complex forelimb movements. However, their intrinsic connectivity and reciprocal functional organization are still unclear, limiting our understanding of how the brain coordinates and executes voluntary movements. Here, we causally probe cortical connectivity and activation patterns triggered by transcranial optogenetic stimulation of ethologically relevant complex movements exploiting a large-scale all-optical method in awake mice. Results show specific activation features for each movement class, providing evidence for a segregated functional organization of CFA and RFA. Importantly, we identify a second discrete lateral grasping representation area, namely the lateral forelimb area (LFA), with unique connectivity and activation patterns. Therefore, we propose the LFA as a distinct forelimb representation in the mouse somatotopic motor map.   Introduction  In rodents, forelimb movements are controlled by two distinct cortical functional areas: the caudal forelimb area (CFA) and the rostral forelimb area (RFA). These areas have been intensely investigated using mainly two different experimental paradigms: (1) the somatotopic mapping of the motor cortex, exploiting electrical or optogenetic stimulation, and (2) the recording of cortical activity during natural movement execution. Despite the extensive number of studies using these alternative approaches, a shared model of the motor cortex functional organization is missing (Morandell and Huber, 2017  Morandell K.   Huber D.   The role of forelimb motor cortex areas in goal directed action in mice.  Sci. Rep.     2017;   7  15759  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-15835-2  Google Scholar  ).There are mainly two models that describe the functional relationship between CFA and RFA. The first model associates the RFA with the primate premotor area and the CFA with the primate M1, following a hierarchical organization (Ebbesen et~al., 2018  Ebbesen C.L.   Insanally M.N.   Kopec C.D.   Murakami M.   Saiki A.   Erlich J.C.   More than just a "motor": recent surprises from the frontal cortex.  J.~Neurosci.     2018;   38  :   9402-9413  https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1671-18.2018  Google Scholar  ). This model is based on evidence demonstrating that RFA and CFA receive reciprocal functional projections generating corticocortical pathways involved in the transmission of forelimb sensory inputs, which seem to be processed first by the CFA (Kunori and Takashima, 2016  Kunori N.   Takashima I.   High-order motor cortex in rats receives somatosensory inputs from the primary motor cortex via cortico-cortical pathways.  Eur. J. Neurosci.     2016;   44  :   2925-2934  https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.13427  Google Scholar  ). Moreover, it has been observed that RFA modulates CFA output, similar to how premotor areas affect motor areas in primates (Deffeyes, 2015  Deffeyes J.E.   Touvykine B.   Quessy S.   Dancause N.   Interactions between rostral and caudal cortical motor areas in the rat.  J.~Neurophysiol.     2015;   113  :   3893-3904  https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00760.2014  Google Scholar  ). Conversely, the second model establishes that these two areas are parts of a highly integrated computational unit with distinct motor functions (Brown and Teskey, 2014},

  title = {Stable, Interactive Modulation of Neuronal Oscillations Produced through Brain-Machine Equilibrium},
  journal = {Cell Reports},
  doi = {10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111616},
  abstract = {Closed-loop interaction has the potential to regulate ongoing brain activity by continuously binding an external stimulation to specific dynamics of a neural circuit. Achieving interactive modulation requires a stable brain-machine feedback loop. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to maintain oscillatory brain activity in a desired state by delivering stimulation accurately aligned with the timing of each cycle. We develop a fast algorithm that responds on a cycle-by-cycle basis to stimulate basal ganglia nuclei at predetermined phases of successive cortical beta cycles in parkinsonian rats. Using this approach, an equilibrium emerges between the modified brain signal and feedback-dependent stimulation pattern, leading to sustained amplification or suppression of the oscillation depending on the phase targeted. Beta amplification slows movement speed by biasing the animal's mode of locomotion. Together, these findings show that highly responsive, phase-dependent stimulation can achieve a stable brain-machine interaction that leads to robust modulation of ongoing behavior.   Introduction  Oscillatory activity in the brain is supported by reciprocal connectivity that allows the firing of action potentials in connected areas to be precisely timed in relation to each other at specific frequencies (Buzs\'aki and Draguhn, 2004  Buzs\'aki G.   Draguhn A.   Neuronal oscillations in cortical networks.  Science.     2004;   304  :   1926-1929  https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1099745  Google Scholar  ). When recorded in the local field potential or electrocorticogram (ECoG), such activities typically wax and wane in amplitude, indicating the fluctuating strength and phase stability of these oscillatory interactions over time (Buzs\'aki et~al., 2012  Buzs\'aki G.   Anastassiou C.A.   Koch C.   The origin of extracellular fields and currents \textemdash{} EEG, ECoG, LFP and spikes.  Nat. Rev.

Importantly, single oscillatory cycles are proposed to provide a temporal framework to bind functionally related activity in many brain networks (Buzs\'aki and Draguhn, 2004  Buzs\'aki G.

  journal = {European Journal of Neuroscience},
  doi = {10.1111/ejn.15858},
  abstract = {In neuroscience research, longitudinal data are often analyzed using ANOVA and MANOVA for repeated measures (rmANOVA/rmMANOVA). However, these analyses have special requirements: the variances of the differences between all possible pairs of within-subject conditions (i.e., levels of the independent variable) must be equal. They are also limited to fixed repeated time intervals and are sensitive to missing data. In contrast, other models, such as the Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) and the Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM), suggest another way to think about the data and the studied phenomenon. Instead of forcing the data into the ANOVAs assumptions, it is possible to design a flexible/personalized model according to the nature of the dependent variable. We discuss some advantages of GEE and GLMM as alternatives to rmANOVA and rmMANOVA in neuroscience research, including the possibility of using different distributions for the parameters of the dependent variable, a better approach for different time length points, and better adjustment to missing data. We illustrate these advantages by showing a comparison between rmANOVA and GEE in a real example and providing the data and a tutorial code to reproduce these analyses in R. We conclude that GEE and GLMM may provide more reliable results when compared to rmANOVA and rmMANOVA in neuroscience research, especially in small sample sizes with unbalanced longitudinal designs with or without missing data.},

  doi = {10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1134-22.2022},
  abstract = {Experimental neuroscience typically uses "  p  -valued" statistical testing procedures (null hypothesis significance testing; NHST) in evaluating its results. The rote, often misguided, application of NHST (Gigerenzer, 2008) has led to errors and "questionable research practices." Although the problems could be avoided with better statistics training (Lakens, 2021), there have been calls to abandon NHST altogether. One suggestion is to replace NHST with "estimation statistics" (Cumming and Calin-Jageman, 2017; Calin-Jageman and Cumming, 2019). Estimation statistics emphasizes the uncertainty inherent in scientific investigations and uses metrics, e.g., confidence intervals (CIs), that draw attention to uncertainty. Besides procedural steps and methods, the Estimation Approach prefers expressing "quantitative," rather than "qualitative" conclusions and making generalizations, rather than testing scientific hypotheses. The Estimation Approach embodies a philosophy of science\textemdash its ultimate goals, experimental mindset, and specific aims\textemdash that diverges unhelpfully from what laboratory-based neuroscience needs. The Estimation Approach meshes naturally with, e.g., clinical neuroscience, drug development, human psychology, and social sciences. It fits less well with much of the neuroscience published in the   Journal of Neuroscience  , for example. In contrast, the philosophy behind NHST fits naturally with traditional, evaluative testing of scientific hypotheses. Finally, some Estimation Approach remedies, e.g., replication, ideally with "preregistration," are incompatible with much experimental neuroscience. This Dual Perspective essay argues that, while neuroscience can benefit from practical aspects of estimation statistics, entirely replacing conventional methods with the Estimation Approach would be a mistake. NHST testing should be retained and improved.    SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT   Experimental neuroscience relies on statistical procedures to assess the meaning and importance of its research findings. Optimal scientific communication demands a common set of assumptions for expressing and evaluating results. Problems arising from misuse of conventional significance testing methods have led to a proposal to replace significance testing with an Estimation Statistics Approach. Practical elements of the Estimation Approach can usefully be incorporated into conventional methods. However, the prevailing philosophy of the Estimation Approach does not address certain important needs of much experimental neuroscience. Neuroscience should adopt beneficial elements of the Estimation Approach without giving up the advantages of significance testing.},

  abstract = {From observations in rodents, it has been suggested that the cellular basis of learning-dependent changes, detected using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be increased dendritic spine density, alterations in astrocyte volume, and adaptations within intracortical myelin. Myelin plasticity is crucial for neurological function and active myelination is required for learning and memory. However, the dynamics of myelin plasticity and how it relates to morphometric-based measurements of structural plasticity remains unknown. We used a motor skill learning paradigm in male mice to evaluate experience-dependent brain plasticity by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in longitudinal MRI, combined with a cross-sectional immunohistochemical investigation. Whole brain VBM revealed non-linear decreases in grey matter volume (GMV) juxtaposed to non-linear increases in white matter volume (WMV) within GM that were best modelled by an asymptotic time course. Using an atlas-based cortical mask, we found non-linear changes with learning in primary and secondary motor areas and in somatosensory cortex. Analysis of cross-sectional myelin immunoreactivity in forelimb somatosensory cortex confirmed an increase in myelin immunoreactivity followed by a return towards baseline levels. Further investigations using quantitative confocal microscopy confirmed these changes specifically to the length density of myelinated axons. The absence of significant histological changes in cortical thickness suggests that non-linear morphometric changes are likely due to changes in intracortical myelin for which morphometric WMV in somatosensory cortex significantly correlated with myelin immunoreactivity. Together, these observations indicate a non-linear increase of intracortical myelin during learning and support the hypothesis that myelin is a component of structural changes observed by VBM during learning.},

  abstract = {Summary  Background  Previous atrial fibrillation screening trials have highlighted the need for more targeted approaches. We did a pragmatic study to evaluate the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm-guided targeted screening approach for identifying previously unrecognised atrial fibrillation.  Methods  For this non-randomised interventional trial, we prospectively recruited patients with stroke risk factors but with no known atrial fibrillation who had an electrocardiogram (ECG) done in routine practice. Participants wore a continuous ambulatory heart rhythm monitor for up to 30 days, with the data transmitted in near real time through a cellular connection. The AI algorithm was applied to the ECGs to divide patients into high-risk or low-risk groups. The primary outcome was newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation. In a secondary analysis, trial participants were propensity-score matched (1:1) to individuals from the eligible but unenrolled population who served as real-world controls. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04208971.  Findings  1003 patients with a mean age of 74 years (SD 8{$\cdot$}8) from 40 US states completed the study. Over a mean 22{$\cdot$}3 days of continuous monitoring, atrial fibrillation was detected in six (1{$\cdot$}6\%) of 370 patients with low risk and 48 (7{$\cdot$}6\%) of 633 with high risk (odds ratio 4{$\cdot$}98, 95\% CI 2{$\cdot$}11\textendash 11{$\cdot$}75, p=0{$\cdot$}0002).

Moreover, the majority of functional connectivity studies have focused on pairwise relationships only, and statistical dependency involving more than two brain regions, on the other hand, is rare. In this paper, we explain how to use total correlation to estimate multivariate connectivity in the brain. We validated our method with more extensive open fMRI datasets under different conditions, respectively. We found that total correlation can reveal substantial information sharing among brain regions, consistent with existing neuroscience studies. On the other hand, total correlation could estimate functional connectivity beyond pairwise brain regions and could be used as a new functional connectivity metric.

Adopting an object-centered approach to test the hypothesis that skilled movement simplifies the whip dynamics, the whip's evolution was characterized in relation to performance error and hand speed. Despite widely differing individual strategies, both discrete and rhythmic styles featured a cascade-like unfolding of the whip. Whip extension and orientation at peak hand speed predicted performance error, at least in the rhythmic style, suggesting that humans accomplished the task by setting initial conditions. These insights may inform further studies on human and robot control of complex objects.},

Results: We propose a neuron reconstruction refinement strategy (NRRS) to fill the gap mentioned ahead. Our strategy partitions neuron morphology reconstruction into fixed-size segments and resolves the deviation problems by two steps of neuron tracing. Furthermore, we build a synthetic dataset severed as validation data for quantifying the exact performance. We show that NRRS can handle most of the defined deviation errors while existing solutions hardly achieve matched performance. In applying our method to SEU-Allen dataset containing nearly 2000 complete neuron reconstructions, we present large improvements obtained in the accuracy of the neuron skeleton representation, the task of radius estimation and axonal bouton detection. The results demonstrate the indispensability of our strategy in refining neuron morphology reconstruction.},

  abstract = {Spontaneous brain activity, measured with resting state fMRI (R-fMRI), is correlated among regions that are co-activated by behavioral tasks. It is unclear, however, whether spatial patterns of spontaneous activity within a cortical region correspond to spatial patterns of activity evoked by specific stimuli, actions, or mental states. The current study investigated the hypothesis that spontaneous activity in motor cortex represents motor patterns commonly occurring in daily life. To test this hypothesis 15 healthy participants were scanned while performing four different hand movements. Three movements (Grip, Extend, Pinch) were ecological involving grip and grasp hand movements; one control movement involving the rotation of the wrist was not ecological and infrequent (Shake). They were also scanned at rest before and after the execution of the motor tasks (resting-state scans). Using the task data, we identified movement-specific patterns in the primary motor cortex. These task-defined patterns were compared to resting-state patterns in the same motor region. We also performed a control analysis within the primary visual cortex. We found that spontaneous activity patterns in the primary motor cortex were more like task patterns for ecological than control movements. In contrast, there was no difference between ecological and control hand movements in the primary visual area. These findings provide evidence that spontaneous activity in human motor cortex forms fine-scale, patterned representations associated with behaviors that frequently occur in daily life.},

  doi = {10.21203/rs.3.rs-2106980/v1},
  abstract = {In primates, neurons giving rise to the corticospinal tract (CST) are distributed in several motor-related areas of the frontal lobe, such as the primary motor cortex (M1), the supplementary motor area (SMA), and the dorsal and ventral divisions of the premotor cortex (PMd, PMv). Recently, we have analyzed the morphology of basal dendrites of CST neurons, i.e., large layer V pyramidal neurons in macaque monkeys and shown that the complexity and spine density of the dendrites vary across the motor-related areas. Here, we investigated the alterations in basal dendrite morphology of CST neurons after spinal cord injury (SCI). In our SCI model, both the intersection number and the spine density of basal dendrites were highly decreased throughout the motor-related areas. Notably, these events were less prominent for the PMd than for the M1, SMA, and PMv. When we further compared the density changes post-SCI of the filopodia-, thin-, stubby-, and mushroom-type spines in individual areas, it was found that the density of filopodia-type (immature) spines was increased for all the areas, whereas the other types of spines exhibited their density reductions. Again, such spine density reductions were so limited for the PMd as compared to the M1, SMA, and PMv.},

The underlying patterns of neural population activity have been explored in the context of movements of the eyes, limbs, tongue, and head in nonhuman primates and rodents. How do networks of neurons produce the slow neural dynamics that prepare specific movements and the fast dynamics that ultimately initiate these movements? Recent work exploits rapid and calibrated perturbations of neural activity to test specific dynamical systems models that are capable of producing the observed neural activity. These joint experimental and computational studies show that cortical dynamics during motor planning reflect fixed points of neural activity (attractors). Subcortical control signals reshape and move attractors over multiple timescales, causing commitment to specific actions and rapid transitions to movement execution. Experiments in rodents are beginning to reveal how these algorithms are implemented at the level of brain-wide neural circuits.},

  abstract = {The brain plays a central role in facilitating vital body functions and in regulating physiological and organ systems, including the skeleto-muscular and locomotor system. While neural control is essential to synchronize and coordinate activation of various muscle groups and muscle fibers within muscle groups in relation to body movements and distinct physiologic states, the dynamic networks of brain-muscle interactions have not been explored and the complex regulatory mechanism of brain-muscle control remains unknown. Here we present a first study of network interactions between brain waves at different cortical locations and peripheral muscle activity across key physiologic states \textendash{} wake, sleep and distinct sleep stages. Utilizing a novel approach based on the Network Physiology framework and the concept of time delay stability, we find that for each physiologic state the network of cortico-muscular interactions is characterized by a specific hierarchical organization of network topology and network links strength, where particular brain waves are main mediators of interaction and control of muscular activity. Further, we uncover that with transition from one physiological state to another, the brain-muscle interaction network undergoes marked reorganization in the profile of network links strength, indicating a direct association between network structure and physiological state and function. The pronounced stratification in brain-muscle network characteristics across sleep stages is consistent for chin and leg muscle groups and persists across subjects, indicating a remarkable universality and a previously unrecognized basic physiologic mechanism that regulates muscle activity even during rest and in the absence targeted direct movement. Our findings demonstrate previously unrecognized coordination between brain waves and activation of different muscle fiber types within muscle groups, laws of brain-muscle cross-communication and principles of network integration and control. These investigations demonstrate the potential of network-based biomarkers for classification of distinct physiological states and conditions, for the diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative, movement and sleep disorders, and for developing efficient treatment strategies.},

Also, a growing number of stimulation methods have emerged to modulate and influence brain activity. Current brain-computer interface (BCI) technology is mainly on therapeutic outcomes, it already demonstrated its efficiency as assistive and rehabilitative technology for patients with severe motor impairments. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies have been used to decode brain signals. Beyond this progress, combining AI with advanced BCIs in the form of implantable neurotechnologies grants new possibilities for the diagnosis, prediction, and treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. In this context, we envision the development of closed loop, intelligent, low-power, and miniaturized neural interfaces that will use brain inspired AI techniques with neuromorphic hardware to process the data from the brain. This will be referred to as Brain Inspired Brain Computer Interfaces (BI-BCIs). Such neural interfaces would offer access to deeper brain regions and better understanding for brain's functions and working mechanism, which improves BCIs operative stability and system's efficiency. On one hand, brain inspired AI algorithms represented by spiking neural networks (SNNs) would be used to interpret the multimodal neural signals in the BCI system. On the other hand, due to the ability of SNNs to capture rich dynamics of biological neurons and to represent and integrate different information dimensions such as time, frequency, and phase, it would be used to model and encode complex information processing in the brain and to provide feedback to the users. This paper provides an overview of the different methods to interface with the brain, presents future applications and discusses the merger of AI and BCIs.},

  abstract = {Understanding how the brain encodes external stimuli and how these stimuli can be decoded from the measured brain activities are long-standing and challenging questions in neuroscience. In this paper, we focus on reconstructing the complex image stimuli from fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) signals. Unlike previous works that reconstruct images with single objects or simple shapes, our work aims to reconstruct image stimuli that are rich in semantics, closer to everyday scenes, and can reveal more perspectives. However, data scarcity of fMRI datasets is the main obstacle to applying state-of-the-art deep learning models to this problem. We find that incorporating an additional text modality is beneficial for the reconstruction problem compared to directly translating brain signals to images. Therefore, the modalities involved in our method are: (i) voxel-level fMRI signals, (ii) observed images that trigger the brain signals, and (iii) textual description of the images. To further address data scarcity, we leverage an aligned vision-language latent space pre-trained on massive datasets. Instead of training models from scratch to find a latent space shared by the three modalities, we encode fMRI signals into this pre-aligned latent space. Then, conditioned on embeddings in this space, we reconstruct images with a generative model. The reconstructed images from our pipeline balance both naturalness and fidelity: they are photo-realistic and capture the ground truth image contents well.},

However, signals from the body can be ambiguous, meaning the brain must take extra steps to interpret them correctly.    ~    Current theories suggest the brain may accomplish this by combining sensory signals with prior expectations. If the brain is very confident in its prior expectations, then this can have strong influences on what is consciously felt. In this talk, I will discuss a study in which 40 participants performed a task testing perception of signals from the stomach, while also undergoing simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) and peripheral physiological recording. We analyzed this data using a novel computational model of how the brain processes sensory information, which allowed us to examine the way prior expectations and learning influenced perception and its neurophysiological correlates.    ~    We found several behavioral and neuroscientific results that support the validity of this modeling approach. This includes relationships between multiple computational processes and reaction times, neural responses, and skin conductance responses indexing peripheral autonomic activity.~We also found evidence that prior expectations may have stronger influences, and change more slowly, in some individuals compared to others.~This sheds light on the neural and computational basis of perceiving gut feelings and may be helpful for understanding individual differences in both healthy and clinical populations.    ~    Series programme:    ~      24  th   October, 4 pm BST / 3 pm GMT - `  Interoception and mental health: integrating mind body and brain interactions  ' with Dr Sahib Khalsa, University of Tulsa      ~      24  th   October, 6 pm BST / 5 pm GMT \textendash{} `  The brain-body axis in neurodevelopmental conditions  '   with Dr Eleanor Palser, University of California, San Francisco      ~      27  th   October, 4 pm BST / 3 pm GMT \textendash{} `  How the brain processes gut feelings  '   with Dr Ryan Smith, University of Tulsa      ~      28  th   October, 3 pm BST / 2 pm GMT \textendash{} `  Heartbeats Influence Perception and Motor Activity'   with Dr Esra AI,~Columbia University            Date and Time    Thursday, October 27, 2022  04:00 pm BST / 03:00 pm GMT          Speakers        Dr Ryan Smith, University of Tulsa    Dr Smith is a Principal Investigator at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research and a Research Associate Professor at the University of Tulsa.

Two macaques reached and grasped while cortical activity was measured with intrinsic signal optical imaging. Activity maps were quantified in relation to microstimulation motor maps from the same hemispheres. Each activity map was comprised of many patches and overlapped surprisingly small portions of the motor map. Functional differences between the patches were inferred from their activity time courses and location within the motor map. We propose that M1/PMd contain subzones that are preferentially tuned for specific actions.
